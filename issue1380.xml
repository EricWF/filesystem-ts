<p><b>Addresses DE-16</b></p>
<p>
Several pair and tuple functions in regard to move
operations are incorrectly specified if the member types
are references, because the result of a std::move cannot
be assigned to lvalue-references. In this context the usage
of the requirement sets MoveConstructible and
CopyConstructible also doesn't make sense, because
non-const lvalue-references cannot satisfy these
requirements.

<resolution>
Replace the usage of std::move by that of
std::forward and replace MoveConstructible and
CopyConstructible requirements by other
requirements.
