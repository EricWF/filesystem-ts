<title>[FCD] <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt> of references need to better specify move-semantics</title>

<p><b>Addresses DE-16</b></p>
<p>
Several <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt> functions in regard to move
operations are incorrectly specified if the member types
are references, because the result of a <tt>std::move</tt> cannot
be assigned to lvalue-references. In this context the usage
of the requirement sets <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> also doesn't make sense, because
non-const lvalue-references cannot satisfy these requirements.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment

<p>
Replace the usage of <tt>std::move</tt> by that of
<tt>std::forward</tt> and replace <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> and
<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements by other requirements.
