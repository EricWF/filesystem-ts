<discussion>
<p>No specification for characters with no representation. The example at the end of
8.4.1 refers to "for other native narrow encodings some characters may have no
representation" â€” what happens in such cases?</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add some definition of the behaviour for characters with no representation.</p>
</resolution>

</issue>
