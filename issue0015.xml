<p>
  No specification for characters with no representation. The example at the end of
  8.4.1 refers to "for other native narrow encodings some characters may have no
  representation" - what happens in such cases?</p>

  <p>Suggested action:</p>
  <p>Add some definition of the behaviour for characters with no representation.</p>

  <note>2014-02-12 Applied LWG/SG-3 Issaquah wording tweaks to make characters referred to plural.</note>

  <note>2014-02-08, Beman Dawes provides wording</note>

<resolution>
  <p>
    <i>Add a paragraph at the end of 8.2.2 [path.type.cvt]:</i>
  </p>
  <blockquote><p>
    <ins>If the encoding being converted to has no representation for source characters,
    the resulting converted characters, if any, are unspecified.</ins>
  </p></blockquote>
