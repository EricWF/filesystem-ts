<discussion>
<p>
  No specification for characters with no representation. The example at the end of
  8.4.1 refers to "for other native narrow encodings some characters may have no
  representation" - what happens in such cases?</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add some definition of the behaviour for characters with no representation.</p>

  <h4>Proposed wording:</h4>

  <p>
    <i>[2014-02-08: Beman Dawes]</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Add a paragraph at the end of 8.2.2 [path.type.cvt]:</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <ins>If the the encoding being converted to has no representation for a source character,
    the resulting converted character, if any, is unspecified.</ins>
  </p>

</resolution>
