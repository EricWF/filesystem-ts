<p>
What would be the value <tt>this_thread::get_id()</tt> when called from a detached thread?
</p>
<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<p>
Add some text to clarify that <tt>get_id()</tt> still returns the same value even after detaching.

<p>
<sref ref=="[thread.thread.this]"/>/1 contains the following sentence describing <tt>this_thread::get_id()</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
... No other thread of execution shall have this id and this thread of execution shall always have this id.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I don't object to adding "even if detached" to this sentence, but it seems unnecessary to me. "Always" means always.</p>
