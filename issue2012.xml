<p>
I'm seeing something strange in the paragraphs <sref ref="[map.modifiers]"/> and <sref ref="[multimap.modifiers]"/>:
they both talk about <tt>tuple&lt;const key_type, mapped_type&gt;</tt> but I think they
should be talking about <tt>pair&lt;const key_type, mapped_type&gt;</tt> because, among
other reasons, a <tt>tuple</tt> is not convertible to a <tt>pair</tt>. If I replace <tt>tuple</tt>
with <tt>pair</tt> everything makes sense to me.

The proposed resolution is obvious.

This is by far not the only necessary fix within both sub-clauses. For details see the 2010-10-29 comment in 
<iref ref="2005"/>.
