It is unclear if a spurious wake-up during the loop and reentering
of the blocked state due to a repeated execution
of the loop will adjust the timer of the blocking with the
respect to the previously specified rel_time value.

Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

<blockquote>
Make it clear (e.g. by a note) that when reexecuting
the loop the waiting time when blocked
will be adjusted with respect to the elapsed time of
the previous loop executions.
