<title>The emplace issue</title>

<p>
In an emplace member function the function parameter pack may be bound
to a priori unlimited number of objects: some or all of them can be
elements of the container itself. Apparently, in order to conform to the
blanket statement <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>/11, the
implementation must check all of them for that possibility. A possible
solution can involve extending the exception in <sref
ref="[container.requirements]"/>/12 also to the emplace member. As a
side note, the <tt>push_back</tt> and <tt>push_front</tt> member
functions are luckily not affected by this problem, can be efficiently
implemented anyway

<blockquote>
<p>
The proposed addition (13) is partially redundant with the existing
paragraph 12. Why was the qualifier "rvalues" added to paragraph 12? Why
does it not cover subelements and pointers?
</p>
<p>
Resolution: Alan Talbot to rework language, then set state to Review.

<blockquote>
<p>
The problem is broader than emplace. The LWG doesn't
feel that it knows how to write wording that prohibits all of the
problematic use cases at this time.

<p>
Add after <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>/12:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-12- Objects passed to member functions of a container as rvalue
references shall not be elements of that container. No diagnostic
required.
</p>
<p>
<ins>
-13- Objects bound to the function parameter pack of the
<tt>emplace</tt> member function shall not be elements or sub-objects of
elements of the container. No diagnostic required.
</ins>
</p>

</blockquote>
