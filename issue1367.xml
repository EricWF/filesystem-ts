<p><b>Addresses GB-72</b></p>
<p>
Dynamic exception specifications are deprecated, so
clause 18.8.2 that describes library support for this facility
should move to Annex D, with the exception of the
<tt>bad_exception</tt> class which is retained to indicate other
failures in the exception dispatch mechanism (e.g. calling
<tt>current_exception()</tt>).
</p>

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

<resolution>
With the exception of 18.8.2.1 [bad.exception],
move clause 18.8.2 diectly to Annex D.
[bad.exception] should simply become the new
18.8.2.
