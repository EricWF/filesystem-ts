<title>String::erase(range) yields wrong iterator</title>
<section><sref ref="[string::erase]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The string::erase(iterator first, iterator last) is specified to return an element one
place beyond the next element after the last one erased. E.g. for the string
&quot;abcde&quot;, erasing the range ['b'..'d') would yield an iterator for element 'e',
while 'd' has not been erased. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[string::erase]"/>, paragraph 10, change: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns: an iterator which points to the element immediately following _last_ prior to
  the element being erased. </p>
</blockquote>
