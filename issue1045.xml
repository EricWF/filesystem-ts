<p>
The precondition that the mutex is not owned by this thread offers
introduces the risk of unnecessary undefined behaviour into the
program. The only time it matters whether the current thread owns the
mutex is in the lock operation, and that will happen subsequent to
construction in this case. The lock operation has the identical
pre-condition, so there is nothing gained by asserting that precondition
earlier and denying the program the right to get into a valid state
before calling lock.
