<pre>
  pos_type basic_stringbuf::seekoff(off_type, ios_base::seekdir,
                                    ios_base::openmode);

<p>
is obliged to fail if nothing has been inserted into the stream. This
is unnecessary and undesirable. It should be permissible to seek to
an effective offset of zero.</p>

<note>
 Sydney: Agreed that this is an annoying problem: seeking to zero should be
 legal. Bill will provide wording.

<resolution>
<p>Change the sentence from:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For a sequence to be positioned, if its next pointer (either
gptr() or pptr()) is a null pointer, the positioning operation
fails.
</p></blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For a sequence to be positioned, if its next pointer (either
gptr() or pptr()) is a null pointer and the new offset newoff
is nonzero, the positioning operation fails.
</p></blockquote>
