<p>
The current throw specification of <tt>async()</tt> does state:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-6- <i>Throws</i>: <tt>system_error</tt> if policy is <tt>launch::async</tt> and 
the implementation is unable to start a new thread.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
First it seems not clear whether this only applies if policy equals 
<tt>launch::async</tt> of if the <tt>async</tt> launch mode flag is set 
(if <tt>policy|launch::async!=0</tt>)
<p/>
In the discussion Lawrence Crowl also wrote:

<blockquote><p>
    More generally, I think what we want to say is that if the
    implementation cannot successfully execute on one of the policies
    allowed, then it must choose another. The principle would apply
    to implementation-defined policies as well.

Should not throw. That was the intent. "is async" meat exactly.
