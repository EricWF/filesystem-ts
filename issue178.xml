<title>Should clog and cerr initially be tied to cout?</title>

Section 27.3.1 says &quot;After the object cerr is initialized,
cerr.flags() &amp; unitbuf is nonzero. Its state is otherwise the same as
required for ios_base::init (lib.basic.ios.cons).  It doesn't say
anything about the the state of clog.  So this means that calling
cerr.tie() and clog.tie() should return 0 (see Table 89 for
ios_base::init effects).
</p>
<p>
Neither of the popular standard library implementations
that I tried does this, they both tie cerr and clog
to &amp;cout. I would think that would be what users expect.

<p>The standard is clear as written.</p>
<p>27.3.1/5 says that &quot;After the object cerr is initialized, cerr.flags()
&amp; unitbuf is nonzero. Its state is otherwise the same as required for
ios_base::init (27.4.4.1).&quot; Table 89 in 27.4.4.1, which gives the
postconditions of basic_ios::init(), says that tie() is 0. (Other issues correct
ios_base::init to basic_ios::init().)</p>
