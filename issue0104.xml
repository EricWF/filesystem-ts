<discussion>
<p>It is not clear that undefined behavior applies when pos == size ()
for the non const version.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Rewrite as: Otherwise, if pos &gt; size () or pos == size () and
the non-const version is used, then the behavior is undefined.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The Standard is correct. The proposed resolution already appears in
the Standard.</p>
</rationale>
</issue>
