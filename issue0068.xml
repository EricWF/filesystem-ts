<title>Extractors for char* should store null at end</title>

<discussion>
<p>Extractors for char* (27.6.1.2.3) do not store a null character
after the extracted character sequence whereas the unformatted
functions like get() do. Why is this?</p>

<p>Comment from Jerry Schwarz: There is apparently an editing
glitch. You'll notice that the last item of the list of what stops
extraction doesn't make any sense. It was supposed to be the line that
said a null is stored.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p><sref ref="[istream::extractors]"/>, paragraph 7, change the last list
item from:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  A null byte (<tt>charT()</tt>) in the next position, which may be
  the first position if no characters were extracted.
</p></blockquote>

<p>to become a new paragraph which reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Operator&gt;&gt; then stores a null byte (<tt>charT()</tt>) in the
  next position, which may be the first position if no characters were
  extracted.
</p></blockquote>
