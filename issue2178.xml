<p>
Given that a number of things were removed from the allocator requirements (<tt>reference</tt>, <tt>const_reference</tt>, 
<tt>address()</tt> in <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>), it seems that these incompatible changes should be 
mentioned in Annex <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, more specifically in [diff.cpp03].

2012-10 Portland: Move to Open 
</note>

<p>
It was clearly pointed out by Bill during the C++11 process that our change to allocator requirements
potentially broke 3rd party user containers written to expect C++03 allocators, or rather, an
allocator written to the minimal requirements of C++11 might not be guaranteed to work with a container
written to the previous rules.  This was a trade-off in making allocaters easier to write by use of
the <tt>allocator_traits</tt> framework.
</p>

<p>
This probably does merit a write-up in Annex C, and we look forward to seeing wording.  Until then,
the best we can do is move the issue to Open.
