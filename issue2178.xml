<p>
Given that a number of things were removed from the allocator requirements (<tt>reference</tt>, <tt>const_reference</tt>, 
<tt>address()</tt> in <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>), it seems that these incompatible changes should be 
mentioned in Annex <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, more specifically in [diff.cpp03].
