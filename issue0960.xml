<p>
<sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements]"/>: paragraph 4 is entitled
"Error conditions", but according to <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>, "Error
conditions:" specifies "the error conditions for error codes reported by
the function." It's not clear what this should mean when there is no
function in sight.

Change <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements]"/> Mutex requirements,
paragraph 4 as indicated:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-4- <del><i>Error conditions:</i></del>
<ins>The error conditions for error codes, if any, reported by member
functions of Mutex type shall be:</ins>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>not_enough_memory</tt> &mdash; if there is not enough memory to construct
the mutex object.
</li>
<li>
<tt>resource_unavailable_try_again</tt> &mdash; if any native handle type
manipulated is not available.
</li>
<li>
<tt>operation_not_permitted</tt> &mdash; if the thread does not have the
necessary permission to change the state of the mutex object.
</li>
<li>
<tt>device_or_resource_busy</tt> &mdash; if any native handle type
manipulated is already locked.
</li>
<li>
<tt>invalid_argument</tt> &mdash; if any native handle type manipulated as
part of mutex construction is incorrect.
</li>
</ul>
