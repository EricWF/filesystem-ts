<p><b>Addresses GB-107</b></p>
<p>
<sref ref="[intro.compliance]"/> p.9 states that which conditionally
supported constructs are available should be provided in the 
documentation for the implementation. This doesn't help programmers trying
to write portable code, as they must then rely on
implementation-specific means to determine the
availability of such constructs. In particular, the presence
or absence of <tt>std::chrono::monotonic_clock</tt> may require
different code paths to be selected. This is the only
conditionally-supported library facility, and differs from the
conditionally-supported language facilities in that it has
standard-defined semantics rather than implementation-defined
semantics.

<p>
Provide feature test macro for determining the
presence of <tt>std::chrono::monotonic_clock</tt>. Add
<tt>_STDCPP_HAS_MONOTONIC_CLOCK</tt> to the
<tt>&lt;chrono&gt;</tt> header, which is defined if
<tt>monotonic_clock</tt> is present, and not defined if it is
not present.

Paper <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3128.html">n3128</a> addresses
this issue by replacing <tt>monotonic_clock</tt> with <tt>steady_clock</tt>, which is not conditionally supported,
so there is no need to detect it.
