<discussion>
1.4p9 states that which conditionally supported constructs
are available should be provided in the documentation for
the implementation. This doesn't help programmers trying
to write portable code, as they must then rely on
implementation-specific means to determine the
availability of such constructs. In particular, the presence
or absence of std::chrono::monotonic_clock may require
different code paths to be selected. This is the only
conditionally-supported library facility, and differs from the
conditionally-supported language facilities in that it has
standard-defined semantics rather than implementationdefined
semantics.

<resolution>
Provide feature test macro for determining the
presence of std::chrono::monotonic_clock. Add
_STDCPP_HAS_MONOTONIC_CLOCK to the
&lt;chrono&gt; header, which is defined if
monotonic_clock is present, and not defined if it is
not present.
