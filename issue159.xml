<title>Strange use of <tt>underflow()</tt></title>

<discussion>
<p>The description of the meaning of the result of
<tt>showmanyc()</tt> seems to be rather strange: It uses calls to
<tt>underflow()</tt>. Using <tt>underflow()</tt> is strange because
this function only reads the current character but does not extract
it, <tt>uflow()</tt> would extract the current character. This should
be fixed to use <tt>sbumpc()</tt> instead.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[streambuf.virt.get]"/> paragraph 1,
<tt>showmanyc()</tt>returns clause, by replacing the word
&quot;supplied&quot; with the words &quot;extracted from the
stream&quot;.</p>
</resolution>
