<title>Underspecification of ios_base::sync_with_stdio</title>

<p>Two problems</p>

<p>(1) 27.4.2.4 doesn't say what ios_base::sync_with_stdio(f)
returns. Does it return f, or does it return the previous
synchronization state? My guess is the latter, but the standard
doesn't say so.</p>

<p>(2) 27.4.2.4 doesn't say what it means for streams to be
synchronized with stdio.  Again, of course, I can make some
guesses. (And I'm unhappy about the performance implications of those
guesses, but that's another matter.)</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change the following sentence in <sref ref="[ios.members.static]"/>
returns clause from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>true</tt> if the standard iostream objects (27.3) are
  synchronized and otherwise returns <tt>false</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>true</tt> if the previous state of the standard iostream
  objects (27.3) was synchronized and otherwise returns
  <tt>false</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add the following immediately after <sref ref="[ios.members.static]"/>,
paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a standard iostream object str is <i>synchronized</i> with a
standard stdio stream f, the effect of inserting a character c by</p>
<pre>
  fputc(f, c);
</pre>

<p>is the same as the effect of</p>
<pre>
  str.rdbuf()-&gt;sputc(c);
</pre>

<p>for any sequence of characters; the effect of extracting a
character c by</p>
<pre>
  c = fgetc(f);
</pre>

<p>is the same as the effect of:</p>
<pre>
  c = str.rdbuf()-&gt;sbumpc(c);
</pre>

<p>for any sequences of characters; and the effect of pushing
back a character c by</p>
<pre>
  ungetc(c, f);
</pre>

<p>is the same as the effect of</p>
<pre>
  str.rdbuf()-&gt;sputbackc(c);
</pre>

<p>for any sequence of characters.  [<i>Footnote</i>: This implies
that operations on a standard iostream object can be mixed arbitrarily
with operations on the corresponding stdio stream.  In practical
terms, synchronization usually means that a standard iostream object
and a standard stdio object share a buffer. <i>--End Footnote</i>]</p>
</blockquote>

<note>pre-Copenhagen: PJP and Matt contributed the definition
of "synchronization"</note>

<note>post-Copenhagen: proposed resolution was revised slightly:
text was added in the non-normative footnote to say that operations
on the two streams can be mixed arbitrarily.</note>
</resolution>
