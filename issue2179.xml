On reflector message <a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=32927">c++std-lib-32927</a>, 
Matt Austern asked whether the following example should be well-defined or not
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct X : public enable_shared_from_this&lt;X&gt; { };
auto xraw = new X;
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp1(xraw);
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp2(xraw);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
pointing out that <sref ref="[util.smartptr.shared.const]"/> does not seem to allow it, since
<tt>xp1</tt> and <tt>xp2</tt> aren't allowed to share ownership, because each of them is required to have 
<tt>use_count() == 1</tt>. Despite this wording it might be reasonable (and technical possible)
to implement that request.
<p/>
On the other hand, there is the non-normative note in <sref ref="[util.smartptr.enab]"/> p11 (already part of TR1):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructors that <span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bold">create unique pointers</span> 
can detect the presence of an <tt>enable_shared_from_this</tt> base and assign the newly created <tt>shared_ptr</tt> 
to its <tt>__weak_this member</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Now according to the specification in <sref ref="[util.smartptr.shared.const]"/> p3-7:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class Y&gt; explicit shared_ptr(Y* p);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
the notion of <em>creating unique pointers</em> can be read to be included by this note, because the post-condition
of this constructor is <tt>unique() == true</tt>. Evidence for this interpretation seems to be weak, though.
<p/>
Howard Hinnant presented the counter argument, that actually the following is an "anti-idiom" and it seems questionable 
to teach it to be well-defined in any case:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto xraw = new X;
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp1(xraw);
shared_ptr&lt;X&gt; xp2(xraw);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
He also pointed out that the current post-conditions of the affected <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructor
would need to be reworded.
<p/>
It needs to be decided, which direction to follow. If this idiom seems too much broken to be supported,
the note could be improved. If it should be supported, the constructors in
<sref ref="[util.smartptr.shared.const]"/> need a careful analysis to ensure that post-conditions
are correct.
<p/>
Several library implementations currently do not support this example, instead they typically
cause a crash. Matt points out that there are currently no explicit requirements imposed on
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> objects to prevent them from owning the same underlying object without sharing the 
ownership. It might be useful to add such a requirement.

More discussion is needed to pick a direction to guide a proposed resolution.

<p>
The note says the newly created <tt>shared_ptr</tt> is assigned to the <tt>weak_ptr</tt> member. It doesn't 
say before doing that the <tt>shared_ptr</tt> should check if the <tt>weak_ptr</tt> is non-empty and possibly 
share ownership with some other pre-existing <tt>shared_ptr</tt>.
