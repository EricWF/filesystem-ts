<discussion>
<p>It is unclear why copy, copy_file and copy_symlink have different return types,
and why the attribute-version of create_directory has a different return type than the
create_directory that takes no attributes. The status/error reporting in these functions
seems inconsistent.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Make the status/error reporting consistent or add a note explaining why it'€™s different.</p>
</resolution>

</issue>
