<p>
It is unclear why <tt>copy</tt>, <tt>copy_file</tt> and <tt>copy_symlink</tt> have different return types,
and why the attribute-version of <tt>create_directory</tt> has a different return type than the
<tt>create_directory</tt> that takes no attributes. The status/error reporting in these functions
seems inconsistent.
<p/>
Resolution:
<p/>
Make the status/error reporting consistent or add a note explaining why it's different.
