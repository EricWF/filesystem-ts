<p>Section 22.2.1.5.2 says that codecvt&lt;&gt;::do_in and do_out
should return the value noconv if &quot;no conversion was
needed&quot;. However, I don't see anything anywhere that defines what
it means for a conversion to be needed or not needed. I can think of
several circumstances where one might plausibly think that a
conversion is not &quot;needed&quot;, but I don't know which one is
intended here. </p>
