<p>
I think it's fairly obvious that <tt>atomic&lt;bool&gt;</tt> is supposed to be derived
from <tt>atomic_bool</tt> (and otherwise follow the <tt>atomic&lt;integral&gt;</tt> interface),
though I think the current wording doesn't support this. I raised this
point along with <tt>atomic&lt;floating-point&gt;</tt> privately with Herb and I seem
to recall it came up in the resulting discussion on this list. However,
I don't see anything on the current libs issue list mentioning this
problem.

<sref ref="[atomics.types.generic]"/>/3 reads
</p>

<blockquote><p>
There are full specializations over the integral types on the atomic
class template. For each integral type integral in the second column of
table 121 or table 122, the specialization <tt>atomic&lt;integral&gt;</tt> shall be
publicly derived from the corresponding atomic integral type in the
first column of the table. These specializations shall have trivial
default constructors and trivial destructors.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Table 121 does not include (<tt>atomic_bool</tt>, <tt>bool</tt>),
so that this should probably be mentioned explicitly in the quoted paragraph.
