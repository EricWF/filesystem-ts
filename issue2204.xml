This note in <sref ref="[reverse.iter.op.star]"/>/2:
</p>
<blockquote>
 [ <i>Note</i>: This operation must use an auxiliary member variable rather than a
 temporary variable to avoid returning a reference that persists beyond the
 lifetime of its associated iterator. (See 24.2.) &mdash;<i>end note</i> ]

<p>
is incorrect because such iterator implementations are ruled out by
<sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/>/6, where it says:
</p>
<blockquote>
 If <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are both dereferenceable, then <tt>a == b</tt> if and only if <tt>*a</tt> and
 <tt>*b</tt> are bound to the same object.

<p>
Alisdair: sugested to strike the "exposition only" member.
<p/>
Daniel: we must check that it wouldn't conflict with a previous solution to another issue.
<p/>
Dietmar: This is an issue but the proposing word is not correct. When we have proxies inside the sequence.
<p/>
Solution: NAD thanks to a contrieved example by Dietmar.
