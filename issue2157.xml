<title>How does <tt>std::array&lt;T,0&gt;</tt> initialization work when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible?</title>

<p>
Objects of <tt>std::array&lt;T,N&gt;</tt> are supposed to be initialized with aggregate initialization (when 
not the destination of a copy or move). This clearly works when <tt>N</tt> is positive. What happens when <tt>N</tt> 
is zero?  To continue using an (inner) set of braces for initialization, a <tt>std::array&lt;T,0&gt;</tt> implementation 
must have an array member of at least one element, and let default initialization take care of those secret elements.  
This cannot work when <tt>T</tt> has a set of constructors and the default constructor is deleted from that set.
Solution: Add a new paragraph in <sref ref="[array.zero]"/>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The unspecified internal structure of array for this case shall allow initializations like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = { };
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and said initializations must be valid even when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible.
</p></blockquote>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3376.</p>

<p>Add the following new paragraph between the current <sref ref="[array.zero]"/> p1 and p2:</p>

<blockquote><p>
-1- <tt>array</tt> shall provide support for the special case <tt>N == 0</tt>.
<p/>
<ins>-?- The unspecified internal structure of <tt>array</tt> for this case shall allow initializations like:</ins>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<ins>array&lt;T, 0&gt; a = { };</ins>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<ins>and said initializations must be valid even when <tt>T</tt> is not default-constructible.</ins>
<p/>
-2- In the case that <tt>N == 0</tt>, <tt>begin() == end() ==</tt> unique value. The return value of 
<tt>data()</tt> is unspecified.
<p/>
-3- The effect of calling <tt>front()</tt> or <tt>back()</tt> for a zero-sized array is undefined.
<p/>
-4- Member function <tt>swap()</tt> shall have a <em>noexcept-specification</em> which is equivalent to 
<tt>noexcept(true)</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
