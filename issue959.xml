<p>
<sref ref="[thread.condition.condvar]"/>: <tt>condition_variable::wait_for</tt>
is required to compute the absolute time by adding the duration value to
<tt>chrono::monotonic_clock::now()</tt>, but <tt>monotonic_clock</tt> is not required to
exist.

Move to open. Associate with LWG <iref ref="859"/> and any other monotonic-clock
related issues.

<blockquote>
I believe that <iref ref="859"/> (currently Ready) addresses this issue, and
that this issue should be marked NAD, solved by <iref ref="859"/> (assuming
it moves to WP).

<rationale>
<p>
<tt>condition_variable::wait_for</tt> no longer refers to
<tt>monotonic_clock</tt>, so this issue is moot.
