<p>
What it means for <tt>high_resolution_clock</tt> to be a synonym
is undefined. If it may or may not be a typedef, then
certain classes of programs become unportable.

Resolution proposed in ballot comment

Require that it be a distinct class type.

This is not a defect.  Threre are a number of places in the standard where
we allow implentations to choose their preferred technique, the most obvious
example being the <tt>iterator</tt>/<tt>const_iterator</tt> types of <tt>set</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Typically, this means it is not portable to declare function overloads that differ
only in their use of these types.
