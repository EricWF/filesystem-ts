<p><b>Addresses GB-127</b></p>

The Bitmask Type requirements in 17.5.2.1.3 p3 say that
all elements on a bitmask type have distinct values, but
28.5.2 defines regex_constants::match_default and
regex_constants::format_default as elements of the
bitmask type regex_constants::match-flag_type, both with
value 0. This is a contradiction.
</discussion>

<resolution>
One of the bitmask elements should be removed
from the declaration and should be defined
separately, in the same manner as
ios_base::adjustfield, ios_base::basefield and
ios_base::floatfield are defined by 27.5.2.1.2p2
and Table 120. These are constants of a bitmask
type, but are not distinct elements, they have
more than one value set in the bitmask.
regex_constants::format_default should be
specified as a constant with the same value as
regex_constants::match_default.
</resolution>
