<sref ref="[locale.money.get.virtuals]"/>, para 3 sentence 4 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
If the first character of <tt>pos</tt> is equal to the first character of <tt>neg</tt>, 
or if both strings are empty, the result is given a positive sign.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
One interpretation is that an input sequence must match either the
positive pattern or the negative pattern, and then in either event it
is interpreted as positive.  The following objections has been raised:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The input can successfully match only a positive sign, so the negative
pattern is an unsuccessful match.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
This discussion applies equally to issue <iref ref="668"/> (q.v.).
Howard has added examples there,
and recommends either NAD or a resolution that adds his (or similar) examples
to the Working Paper.
</p>
<p>
We recommend moving to NAD.
Anyone who feels strongly about adding the examples
is invited to submit corresponding wording.
We further recommend issue <iref ref="668"/> be handled identically.
