<p>
The <tt>&lt;iterator&gt;</tt> header synopsis declares a partial specialization of
<tt>iterator_traits</tt> to support pointers, <sref ref="[iterator.syn]"/>.  The implication
is that specialization will be described in D10, yet it did not follow the
rest of the deprecated material into this clause.
</p>
<p>
However, this is not as bad as it first seems!
There are partial specializations of <tt>iterator_traits</tt> for types that satisfy
the various Iterator concepts, and there are concept_maps for pointers to
explicitly support the <tt>RandomAccessIterator</tt> concept, so the required
template will be present - just not in the manner advertised.
</p>
<p>
I can see two obvious solutions:
</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
Restore the <tt>iterator_traits&lt;T*&gt;</tt> partial specialization in D.10
</li>
<li>
Remove the declaration of <tt>iterator_traits&lt;T*&gt;</tt> from 24.3 synopsis
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I recommend option (ii) in the wording below
</p>
<p>
Option (ii) could be extended to strike all the declarations of deprecated
material from the synopsis, as it is effectively duplicating D.10 anyway.
This is the approach taken for deprecated library components in the 98/03
standards.  This is probably a matter best left to the Editor though.

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[iterator.syn]"/> strike:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<del>template&lt;class T&gt; struct iterator_traits&lt;T*&gt;;</del>
</pre></blockquote>

</resolution>
