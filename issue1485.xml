It is unclear when a <tt>thread::id</tt> ceases to be meaningful.
The sentence "The library may reuse the value of a
<tt>thread::id</tt> of a terminated thread that can no longer be
joined." implies that some terminated threads can be
joined. It says nothing about detached threads.

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote>
Require a unique <tt>thread::id</tt> for every thread that is
(1) detached and not terminated or (2) has an associated <tt>std::thread</tt> 
object.
