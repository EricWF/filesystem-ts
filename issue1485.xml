<discussion>
It is unclear when a thread::id ceases to be meaningful.
The sentence "The library may reuse the value of a
thread::id of a terminated thread that can no longer be
joined." implies that some terminated threads can be
joined. It says nothing about detached threads.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Require a unique thread::id for every thread that is
(1) detached and not terminated or (2) has an
associated std::thread object.
</resolution>
