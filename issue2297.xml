<p>
The wording describes example code including the call of a move constructor, but there is no requirement 
stated that <tt>T</tt> be move constructible. 
<p/>
We would like to add a new Para 1 before existing paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> Type <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> (Table 20) and <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> (Table 22).
</p></blockquote>

<p>
However the <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> concept currently does not cover cases where the source and destination types may differ.
