<p>
<sref ref="[string::replace]"/> basic_string::replace, second
signature, given in paragraph 1, has two "Throws" paragraphs (3 and
5).
</p>

<p>
In addition, the second "Throws" paragraph (5) includes specification
(beginning with "Otherwise, the function replaces ...") that should be
part of the "Effects" paragraph.

<rationale>
<p>This is editorial. Both "throws" statements are true. The bug is
  just that the second one should be a sentence, part of the "Effects"
  clause, not a separate "Throws".  The project editor has been
  notified.</p>
