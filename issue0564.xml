<p>
The   effects  of  the   <code>seekpos()</code>  member   function  of
<code>basic_stringbuf</code>  simply say  that the  function positions
the  input and/or  output  sequences  but fail  to  spell out  exactly
how. This is in contrast  to the detail in which <code>seekoff()</code>
is described.

        <p>

Change 27.7.1.3, p13 to read:

        </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-13- <i>Effects:</i> <ins>Equivalent to <tt>seekoff(off_type(<i>sp</i>), ios_base::beg,
<i>which</i>)</tt>.</ins> <del>Alters the stream position within the controlled sequences,
if possible, to correspond to the stream position stored in <tt><i>sp</i></tt>
(as described below).</del>
</p>
<ul>
<li><del>If <tt>(<i>which</i> &amp; ios_base::in) != 0</tt>, positions the input sequence.</del></li>
<li><del>If <tt>(<i>which</i> &amp; ios_base::out) != 0</tt>, positions the output sequence.</del></li>
<li><del>If <tt><i>sp</i></tt> is an invalid stream position, or if the function
positions neither sequence, the positioning operation fails. If <tt><i>sp</i></tt>
has not been obtained by a previous successful call to one of the positioning
functions (<tt>seekoff</tt>, <tt>seekpos</tt>, <tt>tellg</tt>, <tt>tellp</tt>)
the effect is undefined.</del></li>
</ul>

<note>
Kona (2007): A <tt>pos_type</tt> is a position in a stream by
definition, so there is no ambiguity as to what it means. Proposed
Disposition: NAD

<note>
Post-Kona Martin adds:
I'm afraid I disagree
with the Kona '07 rationale for marking it NAD. The only text
that describes precisely what it means to position the input
or output sequence is in <tt>seekoff()</tt>. The <tt>seekpos()</tt> Effects
clause is inadequate in comparison and the proposed resolution
plugs the hole by specifying <tt>seekpos()</tt> in terms of <tt>seekoff()</tt>.
