<p>
introduces extensions to the C locale mechanism that
allow multiple concurrent locales to be used in the same application
by introducing a type <tt>locale_t</tt> that is very similar to
<tt>std::locale</tt>, and a number of <tt>_l</tt> functions that make use of it.
</p>
<p>
The global locale (set by setlocale) is now specified to be per-
process. If a thread does not call <tt>uselocale</tt>, the global locale is
in effect for that thread. It can install a per-thread locale by
using <tt>uselocale</tt>.
</p>
<p>
There is also a nice <tt>querylocale</tt> mechanism by which one can obtain
the name (such as "de_DE") for a specific <tt>facet</tt>, even for combined
locales, with no <tt>std::locale</tt> equivalent.
</p>
<p>
<tt>std::locale</tt> should be harmonized with the new POSIX <tt>locale_t</tt>
mechanism and provide equivalents for <tt>uselocale</tt> and <tt>querylocale</tt>.

It's our intention to stay in sync with WG14. If WG14 makes a decision
that requires a change in WG21 the issue will be reopened.

Move to NAD Future.
