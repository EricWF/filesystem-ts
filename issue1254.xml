<title>Misleading sentence in <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::flip</tt></title>

<p>
The effects of <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::flip</tt> has the line:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is unspecified whether the function has any effect on allocated but
unused bits.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
While this is technically true, it is misleading, as any member function
in any standard container may change unused but allocated memory. Users
can never observe such changes as it would also be undefined behaviour
to read such memory.
