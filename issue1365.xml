<p><b>Addresses GB-71</b></p>
<p>
The thread safety of <tt>std::set_new_handler()</tt>,
<tt>std::set_unexpected()</tt>, <tt>std::set_terminate()</tt>, is
unspecified making the the functions impossible to use in a thread
safe manner.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment

<p>
The thread safety guarantees for the functions
must be specified and new interfaces should be
provided to make it possible to query and install
handlers in a thread safe way.
