<title>Underspecification of strstreambuf::seekoff</title>
<section><sref ref="[depr.strstreambuf.virtuals]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The standard says how this member function affects the current
stream position. (<tt>gptr</tt> or <tt>pptr</tt>) However, it does not
say how this member function affects the beginning and end of the
get/put area. </p>

<p>This is an issue when seekoff is used to position the get pointer
beyond the end of the current read area. (Which is legal. This is
implicit in the definition of <i>seekhigh</i> in D.7.1, paragraph 4.)
</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG agrees that seekoff() is underspecified, but does not wish
to invest effort in this deprecated feature.</p>
