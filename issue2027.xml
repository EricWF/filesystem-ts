<title>Initialization of the stored task of a <tt>packaged_task</tt></title>

<p>
The move constructor of <tt>packaged_task</tt> does not specify how the stored task is constructed. 
The obvious way is to move-construct it using the task stored in the argument. Moreover, the 
constructor should be provided with a throws clause similar to one used for the other constructors, 
as the move constructor of the stored task is not required to be nothrow.</p>

<p>
As for the other constructors, the terms "stores a copy of <tt>f</tt>" do not reflect the intent, which is 
to allow <tt>f</tt> to be moved when possible.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Change <sref ref="[futures.task.members]"/> paragraph 3:</p>

<blockquote><p>
3 <em>Effects</em>: constructs a new <tt>packaged_task</tt> object with an associated asynchronous state and <del>stores a
copy of <tt>f</tt> as the object's stored task</del><ins>initializes the object's stored task with <tt>std::forward&lt;F&gt;(f)</tt></ins>. 
The constructors that take an <tt>Allocator</tt> argument use it to allocate memory needed to store the internal data structures.
</p></blockquote>

</li>

<li>
<p>Change <sref ref="[futures.task.members]"/> paragraph 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>
5 <em>Effects</em>: constructs a new <tt>packaged_task</tt> object and transfers ownership of <tt>other</tt>'s associated asynchronous
state to <tt>*this</tt>, leaving <tt>other</tt> with no associated asynchronous state. <ins>Moves the stored task from <tt>other</tt> 
to <tt>*this</tt>.</ins>
