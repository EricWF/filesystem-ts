<title>streambuf inserter and extractor should be unformatted</title>

Issue  60 explicitly made  the extractor  and inserter  operators that
take a  <tt>basic_streambuf*</tt> argument formatted  input and output
functions,  respectively.  I  believe that's  wrong, certainly  in the
case of  the extractor, since formatted functions  begin by extracting
and  discarding  whitespace.  The  extractor  should  not discard  any
characters.

I propose to  change each operator to behave  as unformatted input and
output function,  respectively. The changes below are  relative to the
working draft document number N1804.

        </p>
        <p>

Specifically, change 27.6.1.2.3, p14 as follows:

        </p>

            <blockquote>
        <p>

<i>Effects</i>:  Behaves as  a<ins>n un</ins>formatted  input function
(as   described   in   <del>27.6.1.2.1</del><ins>27.6.1.3,   paragraph
1</ins>).

        </p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>

And change 27.6.2.5.3, p7 as follows:

        </p>

            <blockquote>
        <p>

<i>Effects</i>: Behaves  as a<ins>n un</ins>formatted  output function
(as   described   in   <del>27.6.2.5.1</del><ins>27.6.2.6,   paragraph
1</ins>).

        </p>
            </blockquote>
