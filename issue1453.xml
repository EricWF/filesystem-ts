<discussion>
It's unclear how match_results should behave if it has
been default-constructed. The sub_match objects
returned by operator[], prefix and suffix cannot point to the
end of the sequence that was searched if no search was
done. The iterators held by unmatched sub_match objects
might be singular.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Add to match_results::operator[],
match_results::prefix and match_results::suffix:<BR/>
Requires: !empty()
</resolution>
