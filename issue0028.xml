<discussion>
<p>The description of the vector form of ctype&lt;char&gt;::is can be interpreted to mean
something very different from what was intended. Paragraph 4 says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: The second form, for all *p in the range [low, high), assigns vec[p-low] to
  table()[(unsigned char)*p]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is intended to copy the value indexed from table()[] into the place identified in
vec[]. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/>, paragraph 4, to read </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: The second form, for all *p in the range [low, high), assigns into vec[p-low]
  the value table()[(unsigned char)*p]. </p>
