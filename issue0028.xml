<discussion>
<p>The constraint on <tt>last_write_time</tt> is too weak: It is noted that the postcondition
of <tt>last_write_time(p) == new_time</tt> is not specified since it might not hold for file
systems with coarse time granularity.
<p/>
However, might it be possible to have a postcondition that <tt>last_write_time(p) &lt;= new_time</tt> ?</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add postcondition: <tt>last_write_time(p) &lt;= new_time</tt></p>
</resolution>
