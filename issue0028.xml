<discussion>
<p>The constraint on last_write_time is too weak: It is noted that the postcondition
of last_write_time(p) == new_time is not specified since it might not hold for file
systems with coarse time granularity.
However, might it be possible to have a postcondition that
last_write_time(p) <= new_time ?</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add postcondition: last_write_time(p) <= new_time</p>
</resolution>

</issue>
