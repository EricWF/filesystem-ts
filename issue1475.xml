<p>
Change to "The weak compare-and-exchange
operations may fail spuriously, that is, return false
while leaving the contents of memory pointed to
by expected unchanged."

<p>Change <sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/> p. 23 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
23 <em>Remark</em>: <del>The weak compare-and-exchange operations may fail spuriously, that is, return false while
leaving the contents of memory pointed to by <tt>expected</tt> before the operation is the same that same
as that of the <tt>object</tt> and the same as that of <tt>expected</tt> after the operation</del><ins>The weak 
compare-and-exchange operations may fail spuriously, that is, return false while leaving the contents of memory 
pointed to by <tt>expected</tt> unchanged.</ins>. [ <em>Note</em>: This spurious failure enables implementation of 
compare-and-exchange on a broader class of machines, e.g., loadlocked store-conditional machines. A consequence of 
spurious failure is that nearly all uses of weak compare-and-exchange will be in a loop.
<p/>
When a compare-and-exchange is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some
platforms. When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not, the
strong one is preferable. &mdash; <em>end note</em> ]
