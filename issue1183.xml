<title><tt>basic_ios::set_rdbuf</tt> may break class invariants</title>

<p>
The protected member function <tt>set_rdbuf</tt> had been added during the
process of adding move and swap semantics to IO classes. A relevant
property of this function is described by it's effects in
<sref ref="[basic.ios.members]"/>/19:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Effects:</i> Associates the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> object pointed to by sb with
this stream without calling <tt>clear()</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>
This means that implementors of or those who derive from existing IO classes
could cause an internal state where the stream buffer could be 0, but the
IO class has the state <tt>good()</tt>. This would break several currently existing
implementations which rely on the fact that setting a stream buffer via the
currently only ways, i.e. either by calling
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void init(basic_streambuf&lt;charT,traits&gt;* sb);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
or by calling
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
basic_streambuf&lt;charT,traits&gt;* rdbuf(basic_streambuf&lt;charT,traits&gt;* sb);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
to set <tt>rdstate()</tt> to <tt>badbit</tt>, if the buffer is 0. This has the effect that many
internal functions can simply check <tt>rdstate()</tt> instead of <tt>rdbuf()</tt> for being 0.
</p>

<p>
I therefore suggest that a requirement is added for callers of <tt>set_rdbuf</tt> to
set a non-0 value.

</note>

<p>
Change <sref ref="[basic.ios.members]"/> around p. 19 as indicated:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void set_rdbuf(basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;* sb);
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p><del>
<i>Effects:</i> Associates the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> object pointed
to by <tt>sb</tt> with this stream without calling <tt>clear()</tt>.
<i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>rdbuf() == sb</tt>.
</del></p>

<p><ins>
<i>Effects:</i> As if:
</ins></p>

<blockquote><pre><ins>
iostate state = rdstate();
try { rdbuf(sb); }
catch(ios_base::failure) {
   if (0 == (state &amp; ios_base::badbit))
       unsetf(badbit);
}
</ins></pre></blockquote>

<p>
<i>Throws:</i> Nothing.
</p>

<rationale>
We need to be able to call <tt>set_rdbuf()</tt> on stream objects
for which (<tt>rdbuf() == 0</tt>) holds without causing <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> to
be thrown. We also don't want <tt>badbit</tt> to be set as a result of
setting <tt>rdbuf()</tt> to 0 if it wasn't set before the call. This changed
Effects clause maintains the current behavior (as of N2914) without
requiring that <tt>sb</tt> be non-null.

<p>
Several reviewers and the submitter believe that the best solution would be to add a pre-condition that the 
buffer shall not be a null pointer value.

<resolution>
<ol>
<li>Add a new pre-condition just before 27.5.4.2 [basic.ios.members]/23 as indicated:
<blockquote><pre>
void set_rdbuf(basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;* sb);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<ins>?? <em>Requires</em>: <tt>sb != nullptr</tt>.</ins>
<p>
23 <em>Effects</em>: Associates the <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> object pointed to by <tt>sb</tt> with this stream without calling <tt>clear()</tt>.
</p>
<p>
24 <em>Postconditions</em>: <tt>rdbuf() == sb</tt>.
</p>
<p>
25 <em>Throws</em>: Nothing.
</p>

</li>

</resolution>

<rationale>
We believe that setting a <tt>nullptr</tt> stream buffer can be prevented.
