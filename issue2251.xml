<title>C++ library should define <tt>ssize_t</tt></title>

<p>
The C++ standard library defines <tt>size_t</tt>, a typedef for an implementation defined unsigned integer type 
that can represent the sizes of objects. The POSIX standard augments this with <tt>ssize_t</tt>, a typedef for a 
signed integer type that corresponds to <tt>size_t</tt>.
<p/>
The <tt>ssize_t</tt> typedef is useful &mdash; useful enough that the C++ standard even refers to it. (In a 
non-normative footnote in <sref ref="[stream.types]"/>.)  Also, lots of OS vendors add it to their headers anyway, 
even though it isn't part of the C or C++ standards, because those vendors are trying to define headers that 
conform to multiple standards at once. We should make users' and implementers' lives easier by adding 
<tt>ssize_t</tt> to <sref ref="[support.types]"/>.
