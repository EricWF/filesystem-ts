<p>
For <tt>condition_variable_any</tt>, are recursive mutexes allowed? (I think "no")
</p>

<note>
2009-11-17 Moved to Tentatively NAD after 5 positive votes on c++std-lib. 
Rationale added below.

<rationale>
<p>
<tt>condition_variable_any::wait</tt> accepts any type of mutex. It calls
<tt>unlock</tt> precisely once on entry and <tt>lock</tt> precisely once on
exit. It is up to the user to ensure that this provides the required
synchronization. Use of a recursive mutex is safe if either its lock count is 1,
so after the single unlock it can be acquired by another thread, or another
mechanism is used to synchronize the data.
