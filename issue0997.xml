<p>
Many functions are defined as "Effects: Equivalent to a...", which seems
to also define the preconditions, effects, etc. But this is not made
clear.
</p>

<p>
After studying the occurrences of "Effects: Equivalent to", I agree with
the diagnosis but disagree with the solution.  In <sref ref="[string.cons]"/>
we find
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
14 <i>Effects:</i> If <tt>InputIterator</tt> is an integral type, equivalent to
<tt>basic_string(static_cast&lt;size_type&gt;(begin), static_cast&lt;value_type&gt;(end), a)</tt>
</p>
<p>
15 Otherwise constructs a string from the values in the range <tt>[begin,
end)</tt>, as indicated in the Sequence Requirements table (see 23.1.3).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This would be devishly difficult to re-write with an explicit
"Equivalent to:" clause.  Instead, I propose the following, which will
result in much less editorial re-work.

<p>
Add a new paragraph after <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>, p3:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-3- Descriptions of function semantics contain the following elements (as appropriate):<sup>154</sup>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Requires:</i> the preconditions for calling the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Effects:</i> the actions performed by the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Postconditions:</i> the observable results established by the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Returns:</i> a description of the value(s) returned by the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Throws:</i> any exceptions thrown by the function, and the conditions that would cause the exception
</li>
<li>
<i>Complexity:</i> the time and/or space complexity of the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Remarks:</i> additional semantic constraints on the function
</li>
<li>
<i>Error conditions:</i> the error conditions for error codes reported by the function.
</li>
<li>
<i>Notes:</i> non-normative comments about the function
</li>
</ul>

<p><ins>
Whenever the <i>Effects</i> element specifies that the semantics of some
function <tt>F</tt> are <i>Equivalent to</i> some <i>code-sequence</i>, then
the various elements are interpreted as follows.  If <tt>F</tt>'s
semantics specifies a <i>Requires</i> element, then that requirement is
logically imposed prior to the <i>equivalent-to</i> semantics.  Then,
the semantics of the <i>code-sequence</i> are determined by the
<i>Requires</i>, <i>Effects</i>, <i>Postconditions</i>, <i>Returns</i>,
<i>Throws</i>, <i>Complexity</i>, <i>Remarks</i>, <i>Error
Conditions</i> and <i>Notes</i> specified for the (one or more) function
invocations contained in the <i>code-sequence</i>. The value returned from
<tt>F</tt> is specified by <tt>F</tt>'s <i>Returns</i> element, or
if <tt>F</tt> has no <i>Returns</i> element, a non-<tt>void</tt> return from <tt>F</tt> is specified 
by the <i>Returns</i> elements in <i>code-sequence</i>.  If
<tt>F</tt>'s semantics contains a <i>Throws</i> (or
<i>Postconditions</i>, or <i>Complexity</i>) element, then that
supersedes any occurrences of that element in the <i>code-sequence</i>.
