<p>
I think that unordered containers' <tt>reserve</tt> doesn't quite do what it should. I'd expect after calling 
<tt>x.reserve(n)</tt> to be able to insert <tt>n</tt> elements without invalidating iterators. But as 
the standard is written (I'm looking at n3376), I think the guarantee only holds for <tt>n-1</tt> elements.
<p/>
For a container with <tt>max_load_factor</tt> of <tt>1</tt>, <tt>reserve(n)</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>rehash(ceil(n/1))</tt>, ie. <tt>rehash(n)</tt>. <tt>rehash(n)</tt> requires that the bucket
count is <tt>&gt;= n</tt>, so it can be <tt>n</tt> (Table 103). The rule is that <tt>insert</tt>
shall not affect the validity of iterators if <tt>(N + n) &lt; z * B</tt> (<sref ref="[unord.req]"/> p15). 
But for this case the two sides of the equation are equal, so <tt>insert</tt> can affect the validity of iterators.
