<p><b>Addresses UK 98</b></p>

<p>
It would be useful to be able to determine the underlying
type of an arbitrary enumeration type. This would allow
safe casting to an integral type (especially needed for
scoped enums, which do not promote), and would allow
use of <tt>numeric_limits</tt>. In general it makes generic
programming with enumerations easier.

<blockquote>
Pete observes (and Tom concurs)
that the proposed resolution seems to require compiler support
for its implementation,
as it seems necessary to look at the range of values
of the enumerated type.
To a first approximation,
a library solution could give an answer based on the size of the type.
If the user has specialized <tt>numeric_limits</tt> for the enumerated type,
then the library might be able to do better,
but there is no such requirement.
Keep status as Open
and solicit input from CWG.

<blockquote>
Just to confirm that the BSI originator of this comment assumed it did
indeed imply a compiler intrinsic.  Rather than request a Core extension, it
seemed in keeping with that the type traits interface provides a library API
to unspecified compiler features - where we require several other traits
(e.g. <tt>has_trivial_*</tt>) to get the 'right' answer now, unlike in TR1.

Add a new row to the table in <sref ref="[meta.trans.other]"/>:

<tt>T</tt> shall be an enumeration type (<sref ref="[dcl.enum]"/>)

The member typedef <tt>type</tt> shall name the underlying type
of the enum <tt>T</tt>.
