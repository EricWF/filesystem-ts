<title>What types does numpunct grouping refer to?</title>

<p>
Paragraph 16 mistakenly singles out integral types for inserting 
thousands_sep() characters.  This conflicts with the syntax for floating 
point numbers described under 22.2.3.1/2.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change paragraph 16 from:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For integral types, punct.thousands_sep() characters are inserted into 
the sequence as determined by the value returned by punct.do_grouping() 
using the method described in <sref ref="[facet.numpunct.virtuals]"/>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>To:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For arithmetic types, punct.thousands_sep() characters are inserted into 
the sequence as determined by the value returned by punct.do_grouping() 
using the method described in <sref ref="[facet.numpunct.virtuals]"/>.
</p></blockquote>

<note>
Copenhagen: Opinions were divided about whether this is actually an
inconsistency, but at best it seems to have been unintentional.  This
is only an issue for floating-point output: The standard is
unambiguous that implementations must parse thousands_sep characters
when performing floating-point.  The standard is also unambiguous that
this requirement does not apply to the "C" locale.
</note>

<note>
A survey of existing practice is needed; it is believed that some
implementations do insert thousands_sep characters for floating-point
output and others fail to insert thousands_sep characters for 
floating-point input even though this is unambiguously required by the
standard.

<note>Post-Cura&ccedil;ao: the above proposed resolution is the consensus of
Howard, Bill, Pete, Benjamin, Nathan, Dietmar, Boris, and Martin.</note>
