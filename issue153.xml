<title>Typo in <tt>narrow()</tt> semantics</title>
<section><sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The description of the array version of <tt>narrow()</tt> (in
paragraph 11) is flawed: There is no member <tt>do_narrow()</tt> which
takes only three arguments because in addition to the range a default
character is needed.</p>

<p>Additionally, for both <tt>widen</tt> and <tt>narrow</tt> we have
two signatures followed by a <b>Returns</b> clause that only addresses
one of them.</p>

</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change the returns clause in <sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/>
paragraph 10 from:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns: do_widen(low, high, to).</p>

<p>to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns: do_widen(c) or do_widen(low, high, to), 
respectively.</p>

<p>Change <sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/> paragraph 10 and 11 from:</p>
<pre>        char        narrow(char c, char /*dfault*/) const;
        const char* narrow(const char* low, const char* high,
                           char /*dfault*/, char* to) const;</pre>
<pre>        Returns: do_narrow(low, high, to).</pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre>        char        narrow(char c, char dfault) const;
        const char* narrow(const char* low, const char* high,
                           char dfault, char* to) const;</pre>
<pre>        Returns: do_narrow(c, dfault) or
                 do_narrow(low, high, dfault, to), respectively.</pre>

<note>Kona: 1) the problem occurs in additional places, 2) a user
defined version could be different.</note>

<note>Post-Tokyo: Dietmar provided the above wording at the request of
the LWG. He could find no other places the problem occurred. He
asks for clarification of the Kona &quot;a user defined
version...&quot; comment above.  Perhaps it was a circuitous way of
saying &quot;dfault&quot; needed to be uncommented?</note>

<note>Post-Toronto: the issues list maintainer has merged in the
proposed resolution from issue <iref ref="207"/>, which addresses the
same paragraphs.</note>
</resolution>
