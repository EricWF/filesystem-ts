<title>Remaining "<tt>Assignable</tt>" requirement</title>
<section><sref ref="[alg.partitions]"/></section>

<p>
The <i>Requires</i> element of <tt>partition_copy</tt> says (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>InputIterator</tt>'s value type shall be <b><tt>Assignable</tt></b>, and &hellip;
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The C++03 term <tt>Assignable</tt> was replaced by <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>, remaining cleanups happened via LWG issue
<iref ref="972"/>, but algorithm <tt>partition_copy</tt> was not affected at that time (during that time the requirements
of <tt>partition_copy</tt> didn't mention writable nor assignable, but I cannot track down at the moment where these requirements
had been added). Presumably this requirement should be corrected similarly to the approach used in <iref ref="972"/>.
<p/>
Another question is whether a <tt>CopyAssignable</tt> is needed here, given the fact that we already require "writable to" an 
<tt>OutputIterator</tt> which is defined in <sref ref="[iterator.requirements.general]"/> and does already impose the necessary
statement
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
*out = *in;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Given the fact that <tt>partition_copy</tt> never touches any input value twice, there is no reason why anything more than
<i>writable to</i> should be necessary.
<p/>
The below suggested primary resolution does not respond to the second part of this question.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3797.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[alg.partitions]"/>, p12 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
-12- <i>Requires</i>: <tt>InputIterator</tt>'s value type shall be <tt><ins>Copy</ins>Assignable</tt>, and shall be writable 
to the <tt>out_true</tt> and <tt>out_false</tt> <tt>OutputIterator</tt>s, and shall be convertible to <tt>Predicate</tt>'s 
argument type. The input range shall not overlap with either of the output ranges.
</p></blockquote>

</ol>
