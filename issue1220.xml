<p>
Change <sref ref="[thread.condition]"/>, p1:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Condition variables provide synchronization primitives used to block a
thread until notified by some other thread that some condition is met or
until a system time is reached. Class <tt>condition_variable</tt>
provides a condition variable that can only wait on an object of type
<tt>unique_lock<ins>&lt;mutex&gt;</ins></tt>, allowing maximum
efficiency on some platforms. Class <tt>condition_variable_any</tt>
provides a general condition variable that can wait on objects of
user-supplied lock types.
