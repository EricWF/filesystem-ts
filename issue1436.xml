All the random number engine types in this clause have a
constructor taking an unsigned integer type, and a
constructor template for seed sequences. This means that
an attempt to create a random number engine seeded by
an integer literal must remember to add the appropriate
unsigned suffix to the literal, as a signed integer will
attempt to use the seed sequence template, yielding
undefined behaviour, as per 26.5.1.1p1a. It would be
helpful if at least these anticipated cases produced a
defined behaviour, either an erroneous program with
diagnostic, or a conversion to unsigned int forwarding to
the appropriate constructor.
