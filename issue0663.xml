<sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> para 5 says
</p>

<blockquote><p>
-5- Complexity requirements specified in the library
clauses are upper bounds, and implementations that provide better
complexity guarantees satisfy the requirements.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The following
objection has been raised:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The library clauses suggest general
guidelines regarding complexity, but we have been unable to discover
any absolute hard-and-fast formulae for these requirements. Unless
or until the Library group standardizes specific hard-and-fast
formulae, we regard all the complexity requirements as subject to a
"fudge factor" without any intrinsic upper bound.
