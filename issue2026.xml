<title><tt>hash</tt> should be <tt>std</tt> qualified for unordered container</title>

Tom Plum pointed out to me that there's an apparent inconsistency in the <tt>std::</tt> qualification of template names in the unordered containers:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
 template &lt;class Key,
           class T,
           class Hash = hash&lt;Key&gt;,
           class Pred = std::equal_to&lt;Key&gt;,
           class Alloc = std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;const Key, T&gt; &gt; &gt;
   class unordered_map;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Is there a reason that hash is not qualified with <tt>std::</tt>? TR1 also
does not use <tt>std::</tt> here.
</p>

I assumed (I might be wrong) it is because <tt>hash</tt> is designed to be a
customisation point, like <tt>swap</tt>.

<p>I think this is incorrect.  We mean <tt>std::hash</tt>, though clients
are free to specialize <tt>std::hash</tt> on user-defined types.  With the
possible exception of <tt>begin</tt>/<tt>end</tt> (which I'm not sure if
we've settled that), <tt>swap</tt> is the only intended customization point (look up a function by ADL) in the <tt>std::</tt> lib.

<p>I recommend NAD, due to <sref ref="[contents]"/> p3:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whenever a name <tt>x</tt> defined in the standard library is mentioned, the name <tt>x</tt> is assumed to be fully qualified
as <tt>::std::x</tt>, unless explicitly described otherwise. For example, if the Effects section for library function <tt>F</tt>
is described as calling library function <tt>G</tt>, the function <tt>::std::G</tt> is meant.
