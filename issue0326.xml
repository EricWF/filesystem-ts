<title>Missing typedef in moneypunct_byname</title>
<section><sref ref="[locale.moneypunct.byname]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The definition of the moneypunct facet contains the typedefs char_type
and string_type. Only one of these names, string_type, is defined in
the derived facet, moneypunct_byname.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>For consistency with the numpunct facet, add a typedef for
char_type to the definition of the moneypunct_byname facet in
<sref ref="[locale.moneypunct.byname]"/>.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The absence of the typedef is irrelevant.  Users can still access
the typedef, because it is inherited from the base class.</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
