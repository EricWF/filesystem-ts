<title><tt>seed_seq::size</tt> no longer useful</title>
<section><sref ref="[rand.util.seedseq]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
One of the motivations for incorporating <tt>seed_seq::size()</tt>
was to simplify the wording
in other parts of <sref ref="[rand]"/>.
As a side effect of resolving related issues,
all such references
to <tt>seed_seq::size()</tt> will have been excised.
More importantly,
the present specification is contradictory,
as "The number of 32-bit units the object can deliver"
is not the same as "the result of <tt>v.size()</tt>."
