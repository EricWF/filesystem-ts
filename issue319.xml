<discussion>
<p>The standard specifies <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> that "Required
behavior" elements describe "the semantics of a function definition
provided by either the implementation or a C++ program."</p>

<p>The standard specifies <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> that "Requires"
elements describe "the preconditions for calling the function."</p>

<p>In the sections noted below, the current wording specifies
"Required Behavior" for what are actually preconditions, and thus
should be specified as "Requires".</p>
