<p><b>Addresses GB-88</b></p>
<p>
The tuple_cat template consists of four overloads and that
can concatenate only two tuples. A single variadic
signature that can concatenate an arbitrary number of
tuples would be preferred.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
Adopt a simplified form of the proposal in n2795,
restricted to tuples and neither requiring nor
outlawing support for other tuple-like types.
</resolution>
