<title>More restrictions on macro names</title>
<section><sref ref="[macro.names]"/></section>

<discussion>
A program is currently forbidden to use keywords as macro names. This restriction should be strengthened to include all identifiers 
that could be used by the library as attribute-tokens (for example <tt>noreturn</tt>, which is used by header <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>) 
and the special identifiers introduced recently for override control (these are not currently used in the library public interface,
but could potentially be used by the implementation or in future revisions of the library).

<resolution>
<p>Modify <sref ref="[macro.names]"/> paragraph 2 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
A translation unit shall not <tt>#define</tt> or <tt>#undef</tt> names
lexically identical to keywords<ins>, to the identifiers listed in Table
X [Identifiers with special meaning], or to the <i>attribute-tokens</i>
described in clause 7.6 [dcl.attr]</ins>.
</blockquote>
