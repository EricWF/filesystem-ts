Table 17: Random distribution requirements
</p>
<p>
Row 1 requires that each random distribution provide a nested type "input_type";
this type denotes the type of the values that the distribution consumes.
</p>
<p>
Inspection of all distributions in [tr.rand.dist] reveals that each distribution
provides a second typedef ("result_type") that denotes the type of the values the
distribution produces when called.  
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
It seems to me that this is also a requirement
for all distributions and should therefore be  indicated as such via a new second
row to this table 17:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>X::result_type</td><td>T</td><td>---</td><td>compile-time</td></tr>
</table>

<note>
Berlin:  Voted to WP.  N1932 adopts the proposed resolution:  see Table 5 row 1.
