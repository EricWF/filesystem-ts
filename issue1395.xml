<p>
Representations of reference link are not unified.
Most reference links to clause (table) number, say X, are
in the form "Clause X" ("Table X") capitalized, and
subsection Y.Y.Y is referenced with its number only in the
form "Y.Y.Y". Whether they are parenthesized or not
depends on the context.
However there are some notations "(Z)" consisting of only
a number Z in parentheses to confer Clause or Table
number Z.
