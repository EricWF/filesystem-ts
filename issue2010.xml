<title><tt>is_* traits</tt> for binding operations can't be meaningfully specialized</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[func.bind.isbind]"/> says for <tt>is_bind_expression</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Users may specialize this template to indicate that a type should be
treated as a subexpression in a <tt>bind</tt> call.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
But it also says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
If <tt>T</tt> is a type returned from <tt>bind</tt>,
<tt>is_bind_expression&lt;T&gt;</tt> shall be publicly derived from
<tt>integral_constant&lt;bool, true&gt;</tt>, otherwise from
<tt>integral_constant&lt;bool, false&gt;</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This means that while the user is free to specialize, any specialization
would have to be <tt>false</tt> to avoid violating the second
requirement. A similar problem exists for <tt>is_placeholder</tt>.

<p>
Alisdair recognises this is clearly a bug introduced by some wording he
wrote, the sole purpose of this metafunction is as a customization point
for users to write their own <tt>bind</tt>-expression types that participate
in the standard library <tt>bind</tt> protocol.  The consensus was that this
should be fixed in Madrid, moved to Open.
