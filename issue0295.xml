<title>Is abs defined in &lt;cmath&gt;?</title>
<section><sref ref="[c.math]"/></section>

<p>
Table 80 lists the contents of the &lt;cmath&gt; header.  It does not
list <tt>abs()</tt>.  However, 26.5, paragraph 6, which lists added 
signatures present in &lt;cmath&gt;, does say that several overloads
of <tt>abs()</tt> should be defined in &lt;cmath&gt;.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Add <tt>abs</tt> to Table 80.  Also, remove the parenthetical list
of functions "(abs(), div(), rand(), srand())" from <sref ref="[numarray]"/>,
paragraph 1.
</p>

<note>Copenhagen: Modified proposed resolution so that it also gets
rid of that vestigial list of functions in paragraph 1.</note>

<rationale>
<p>All this DR does is fix a typo; it's uncontroversial.  A 
separate question is whether we're doing the right thing in 
putting some overloads in &lt;cmath&gt; that we aren't also 
putting in &lt;cstdlib&gt;.  That's issue <iref ref="323"/>.</p>
