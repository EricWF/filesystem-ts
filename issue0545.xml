<title>When is a deleter deleted?</title>

<p>
The description of ~shared_ptr doesn't say when the shared_ptr's deleter, if
any, is destroyed. In principle there are two possibilities: it is destroyed
unconditionally whenever ~shared_ptr is executed (which, from an implementation
standpoint, means that the deleter is copied whenever the shared_ptr is copied),
or it is destroyed immediately after the owned pointer is destroyed (which, from
an implementation standpoint, means that the deleter object is shared between
instances). We should say which it is.

<p>
Add after the first sentence of <sref ref="[util.smartptr.getdeleter]"/>/1:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The returned pointer remains valid as long as there exists a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> instance
that owns <tt><i>d</i></tt>.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Note:</i> it is unspecified whether the pointer remains valid longer than that.
This can happen if the implementation doesn't destroy the deleter until all
<tt>weak_ptr</tt> instances in the ownership group are destroyed. <i>-- end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
