<title>Table 82 mentions unrelated headers</title>

<p>
Table 82 in section 27 mentions the header &lt;cstdlib&gt; for String
streams (<sref ref="[string.streams]"/>) and the headers &lt;cstdio&gt; and
&lt;cwchar&gt; for File streams (<sref ref="[file.streams]"/>). It's not clear
why these headers are mentioned in this context since they do not
define any of the library entities described by the
subclauses. According to <sref ref="[contents]"/>, only such headers
are to be listed in the summary.

<resolution>
<p>Remove &lt;cstdlib&gt; and &lt;cwchar&gt; from
Table 82.</p>

<note>Copenhagen: changed the proposed resolution slightly.  The
original proposed resolution also said to remove &lt;cstdio&gt; from
Table 82.  However, &lt;cstdio&gt; is mentioned several times within
section <sref ref="[file.streams]"/>, including <sref ref="[c.files]"/>.</note>
