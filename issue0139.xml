<title>Optional sequence operation table description unclear</title>

<discussion>
<p>The sentence introducing the Optional sequence operation table
(23.1.1 paragraph 12) has two problems:</p>

<p>A. It says ``The operations in table 68 are provided only for the containers for which
they take constant time.''<br/>
<br/>
That could be interpreted in two ways, one of them being ``Even though table 68 shows
particular operations as being provided, implementations are free to omit them if they
cannot implement them in constant time.''<br/>
<br/>
B. That paragraph says nothing about amortized constant time, and it should.&nbsp;</p>

<resolution>
<p>Replace the wording in 23.1.1 paragraph 12&nbsp; which begins ``The operations in table 68 are provided only...&quot;
with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Table 68 lists sequence operations that are provided for some types of sequential
  containers but not others. An implementation shall provide these operations for all
  container types shown in the ``container'' column, and shall implement them so as to take
  amortized constant time.</p>
