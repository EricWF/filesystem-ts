<blockquote>
  <p>If Facet is not present in a locale (or, failing that, in the global locale), it throws
  the standard exception bad_cast. </p>
</blockquote>

from an old draft. </p>
</discussion>

<p>In <sref ref="[locale]"/>, paragraph 4, delete the parenthesized
expression </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(or, failing that, in the global locale) </p>
</blockquote>
