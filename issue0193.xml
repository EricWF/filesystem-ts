<title>Heap operations description incorrect</title>

<discussion>
<p>25.3.6 [lib.alg.heap.operations] states two key properties of a heap [a,b), the first of them
is<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `"(1) *a is the largest element"<br/>
<br/>
I think this is incorrect and should be changed to the wording in the proposed
resolution.</p>
<p>Actually there are two independent changes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A-&quot;part of largest equivalence class" instead of "largest", cause 25.3
  [lib.alg.sorting] asserts "strict weak ordering" for all its sub clauses.</p>
  <p>B-Take 'an oldest' from that equivalence class, otherwise the heap functions  could not be used for a
  priority queue as explained in 23.2.3.2.2 [lib.priqueue.members] (where I assume that a "priority queue" respects  priority AND time).</p>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[alg.heap.operations]"/> property (1) from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) *a is the largest element</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) There is no element greater than <tt>*a</tt></p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>
