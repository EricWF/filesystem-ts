<title>Container requirements and placement new</title>

<p>Nothing in the standard appears to make this program ill-formed:</p>

<pre>
  struct C {
    void* operator new( size_t s ) { return ::operator new( s ); }
    // NOTE: this hides in-place and nothrow new
  };

  int main() {
    vector&lt;C> v;
    v.push_back( C() );
  }
</pre>

<p>Is that intentional?  We should clarify whether or not we intended
  to require containers to support types that define their own special
  versions of <tt>operator new</tt>.</p>

<note>
Lillehammer: A container will definitely never use this overridden
operator new, but whether it will fail to compile is unclear from the
standard.  Are containers supposed to use qualified or unqualified
placement new?  20.4.1.1 is somewhat relevant, but the standard
doesn't make it completely clear whether containers have to use
Allocator::construct(). If containers don't use it, the details of how
containers use placement new are unspecified. That is the real bug,
but it needs to be fixed as part of the allocator overhaul.  Weak
support that the eventual solution should make this code well formed.
