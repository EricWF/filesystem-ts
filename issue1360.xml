<p>
The atomic operations facility is closely tied to clause 1
and the memory model. It is not easily supplied as an
after-market extension, and should be trivial to implement
of a single-threaded serial machine. The consequence of
not having this facility will be poor interoperability with
future C++ libraries that memory model concerns
seriously, and attempt to treat them in a portable way.

Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.
