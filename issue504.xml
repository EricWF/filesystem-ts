<discussion>
<p>
In [tr.rand.req], Paragraph 2 states that "... s is a value of integral type,
g is an ... object returning values of unsigned integral type ..."
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
In 5.1.1 [tr.rand.req], Paragraph 2 replace
</p>

<blockquote><p>
... s is a value of integral type, g is an lvalue of a type other than X that
defines a zero-argument function object returning values of <del>unsigned integral</del> type
<ins><tt>unsigned long int</tt></ins>,
...
</p></blockquote>

<p>
In 5.1.1 [tr.rand.seq], Table 16, replace in the line for X(s)
</p>

<blockquote><p>
creates an engine with the initial internal state
determined by <ins><tt>static_cast&lt;unsigned long&gt;(</tt></ins><tt><i>s</i></tt><ins><tt>)</tt></ins>
</p></blockquote>

<note>
Mont Tremblant:  Both s and g should be unsigned long.
This should refer to the constructor signatures. Jens  provided wording post Mont Tremblant.

<note>
Berlin:  N1932 adopts the proposed resolution:  see 26.3.1.3/1e and Table 3 row 2. Moved
to Ready.

<rationale>
<p>
Jens:  Just requiring X(unsigned long) still makes it possible
for an evil library writer to also supply a X(int) that does something
unexpected.  The wording above requires that X(s) always performs
as if X(unsigned long) would have been called.  I believe that is
sufficient and implements our intentions from Mont Tremblant.  I
see no additional use in actually requiring a X(unsigned long)
signature.  u.seed(s) is covered by its reference to X(s), same
arguments.
