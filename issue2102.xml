<title>Why is <tt>std::launch</tt> an implementation-defined type?</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[futures.overview]"/> says <tt>std::launch</tt> is an
implementation-defined bitmask type, which would usually mean the
implementation can choose whether to define an enumeration type, or a
biset, or an integer type.  But in the case of <tt>std::launch</tt> it's
required to be a scoped enumeration type, 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
enum class launch : <i>unspecified</i> {
  async = <i>unspecified</i>,
  deferred = <i>unspecified</i>,
  <i>implementation-defined</i>
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
so what is implementation defined about it, and what is an implementation supposed to document
about its choice?
</p>

</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to the FDIS.</p>

<p>Change <sref ref="[futures.overview]"/> paragraph 2 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The enum type <tt>launch</tt> is <del>an implementation-defined</del><ins>a</ins> bitmask type 
(<sref ref="[bitmask.types]"/>) with <tt>launch::async</tt> and <tt>launch::deferred</tt> 
denoting individual bits. [ <i>Note</i>: Implementations can provide bitmasks to specify restrictions
on task interaction by functions launched by <tt>async()</tt> applicable to a corresponding subset of
available launch policies. Implementations can extend the behavior of the first overload of <tt>async()</tt> by
adding their extensions to the launch policy under the “as if” rule. &mdash; <i>end note</i> ]
</p></blockquote>
