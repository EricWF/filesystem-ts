<p><b>Addresses US-160</b></p>

The last sentence of <sref ref="[atomics.types.integral]"/> p.1 says:
<blockquote><p>
Table 143 shows typedefs to atomic integral classes and the corresponding <tt>&lt;cstdint&gt;</tt> typedefs.
</p></blockquote>
That's nice, but nothing says these are supposed to be part of the implementation, and
they are not listed in the synopsis.

<note>
Proposed resolution as of NB comment
</note>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Remove Table 143 &mdash; Atomics for standard typedef types.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>Change <sref ref="[atomics.types.integral]"/> p.1 as indicated:
<blockquote><p>
1 The name <tt>atomic_<em>itype</em></tt> and the functions operating on it in the preceding synopsis are placeholders for a
set of classes and functions. Throughout the preceding synopsis, <tt>atomic_<em>itype</em></tt> should be replaced by each
of the class names in Table 142 and integral should be replaced by the integral type corresponding to the
class name. <del>Table 143 shows typedefs to atomic integral classes and the corresponding <tt>&lt;cstdint&gt;</tt> typedefs.</del>
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
