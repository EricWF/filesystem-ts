<discussion>
The last sentence of 29.5.1 [atomics.types.integral]/1 says
"Table 143 shows typedefs to atomic integral classes and
the corresponding typedefs." That's nice, but nothing says
these are supposed to be part of the implementation, and
they are not listed in the synopsis.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Remove Table 143 and the last sentence of
29.5.1 [atomics.types.integral]/1.
</resolution>
