<p>
I am trying to decide is a pure virtual function is a <i>necessary</i> as well as
sufficient requirement to be classified as abstract?
</p>
<p>
For instance, is the following (non-polymorphic) type considered abstract?
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct abstract {
protected:
 abstract(){}
 abstract( abstract const &amp; ) {}
 ~abstract() {}
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
(Suggested that this may be NAD, with an editorial fix-up from Pete on the
core wording to make clear that abstract requires a pure virtual function)
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Core has clarified that the definition abstract is adequate. Issue withdrawn by submitter. NAD.
</p>
</resolution>
