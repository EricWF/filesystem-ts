<p>
20.4.9 [lib.meta.req], Implementation requirements, provides latitude for type
traits implementers that is not needed in C++0x. It includes the wording:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note:</i> the latitude granted to implementers in this clause is temporary,
and is expected to be removed in future revisions of this document. -- <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
