<p>
Paragraph 6 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
... obtained by successive invocations of g, ... 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We recommend instead:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
... obtained by taking successive invocations of g mod 2**32, ...
</p></blockquote>
<p>
as the context seems to require only 32-bit quantities be used here.
