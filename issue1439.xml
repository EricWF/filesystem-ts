<p>
These two distributions have a member function called
<tt>densities()</tt> which returns a <tt>vector&lt;double&gt;</tt>. The
distribution is templated on <tt>RealType</tt>. The distribution
also has another member called <tt>intervals()</tt> which returns
a <tt>vector&lt;RealType&gt;</tt>. Why doesn't densities return
<tt>vector&lt;RealType&gt;</tt> as well? If <tt>RealType</tt> is <tt>long double</tt>,
the computed densities property isn't being computed to
the precision the client desires. If <tt>RealType</tt> is <tt>float</tt>, the
densities vector is taking up twice as much space as the client desires.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote>
<p>
Change the piecewise constant and linear
distributions to hold / return the densities in a
<tt>vector&lt;result_type&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
If this is not done, at least correct <sref ref="[rand.dist.samp.pconst]"/> p. 13 which describes
the return of densities as a <tt>vector&lt;result_type&gt;</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<note>
Batavia 2010: After reviewing this issue, the working group concurred with the first of the 
suggestions proposed by the NB comment: "Change the piecewise constant and linear distributions 
to hold&#47;return the densities in a vector. "

<li>Change <sref ref="[rand.dist.samp.pconst]"/> p. 2, class template <tt>piecewise_constant_distribution</tt> synopsis
and the prototype description <sref ref="[rand.dist.samp.pconst]"/> before p. 13 as indicated:
<blockquote><pre>
vector&lt;<del>double</del><ins>result_type</ins>&gt; densities() const;
</pre></blockquote>

<li>Change <sref ref="[rand.dist.samp.plinear]"/> p. 2, class template <tt>piecewise_linear_distribution</tt> synopsis
