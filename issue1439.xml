<discussion>
These two distributions have a member function called
densities() which returns a vector&lt;double&gt;. The
distribution is templated on RealType. The distribution
also has another member called intervals() which returns
a vector&lt;RealType&gt;. Why doesn't densities return
vector&lt;RealType&gt; as well? If RealType is long double,
the computed densities property isn't being computed to
the precision the client desires. If RealType is float, the
densities vector is taking up twice as much space as the
client desires.

<resolution>
Change the piecewise constant and linear
distributions to hold / return the densities in a
vector&lt;result_type&gt;.<BR/>
If this is not done, at least
correct[rand.dist.samp.pconst]/13 which describes
the return of densities as a vector&lt;result_type&gt;.
