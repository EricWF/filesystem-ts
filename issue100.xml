<discussion>
<p>Overspecified For an insert iterator it, the expression *it is
required to return a reference to it. This is a simple possible
implementation, but as the SGI STL documentation says, not the only
one, and the user should not assume that this is the case.</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG believes this causes no harm and is not a defect in the
standard. The only example anyone could come up with caused some
incorrect code to work, rather than the other way around.</p>
