<title>division should be floating-point, not integer</title>

Paragraph 10 describes how a variate generator uses numbers produced by an
engine to pass to a generator. The sentence that concerns me is: "Otherwise, if
the value for engine_value_type::result_type is true and the value for
Distribution::input_type is false [i.e. if the engine produces integers and the
engine wants floating-point values], then the numbers in s_eng are divided by
engine().max() - engine().min() + 1 to obtain the numbers in s_e." Since the
engine is producing integers, both the numerator and the denominator are
integers and we'll be doing integer division, which I don't think is what we
want. Shouldn't we be performing a conversion to a floating-point type first?

Recommend NAD as the affected section is now gone and so the issue is moot.
