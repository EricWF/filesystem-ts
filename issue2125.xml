<p>
<sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.class]"/> says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class <tt>timed_mutex</tt> shall satisfy all of the <tt>TimedMutex</tt> requirements (<sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/>). 
It shall be a standardlayout class (Clause <sref ref="[class]"/>).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Problem here is that <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/> does not define a requirement set named &quot;<tt>TimedMutex</tt>&quot;,
it only refers to &quot;<i>timed mutex types</i>&quot;
</p>

<note>2012, Portland: move to Tentatively NAD Editorial</note>
<p>
We have timed mutex type, but it is labeled timed mutex requirements
</p>
<p>
We can make a suggestion, but will send to the editor as it seems purely editorial.
There is a typo, and we don't have the timed mutex but <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/> already
says timed mutex type, and we need to reuse that term down in the class to fulfil the mutex requirement.
</p>
<note>To Editor:</note>
<p>
Replace this one with timed mutex type.
