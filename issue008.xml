<title>Locale::global lacks guarantee</title>

<discussion>
<p>It appears there's an important guarantee missing from clause
22. We're told that invoking locale::global(L) sets the C locale if L
has a name. However, we're not told whether or not invoking
setlocale(s) sets the global C++ locale. </p>

<p>The intent, I think, is that it should not, but I can't find any
such words anywhere. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add a sentence at the end of <sref ref="[locale.statics]"/>,
paragraph 2:&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No library function other than <tt>locale::global()</tt> shall affect 
  the value returned by <tt>locale()</tt>. </p>

</blockquote>
