<title>Strange <tt>seekpos()</tt> semantics due to joint position</title>

<discussion>
<p>Overridden virtual functions, seekpos()</p> <p>In <sref ref="[filebuf]"/> paragraph 3, it is stated that a joint input and
output position is maintained by <tt>basic_filebuf</tt>. Still, the
description of <tt>seekpos()</tt> seems to talk about different file
positions. In particular, it is unclear (at least to me) what is
supposed to happen to the output buffer (if there is one) if only the
input position is changed. The standard seems to mandate that the
output buffer is kept and processed as if there was no positioning of
the output position (by changing the input position). Of course, this
can be exactly what you want if the flag <tt>ios_base::ate</tt> is
set. However, I think, the standard should say something like
this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If <tt>(which &amp; mode) == 0</tt> neither read nor write position is
    changed and the call fails. Otherwise, the joint read and write position is
    altered to correspond to <tt>sp</tt>.</li>
  <li>If there is an output buffer, the output sequences is updated and any
    unshift sequence is written before the position is altered.</li>
  <li>If there is an input buffer, the input sequence is updated after the
    position is altered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus the appropriate error handling, that is...</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change the unnumbered paragraph in 27.8.1.4 (lib.filebuf.virtuals) before
paragraph 14 from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp, ios_base::openmode = ios_base::in |
  ios_base::out);</p>
  <p>Alters the file position, if possible, to correspond to the position stored
  in sp (as described below).</p>
  <p>- if (which&amp;ios_base::in)!=0, set the file position to sp, then update
  the input sequence</p>
  <p>- if (which&amp;ios_base::out)!=0, then update the output sequence, write
  any unshift sequence, and set the file position to sp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp, ios_base::openmode = ios_base::in |
  ios_base::out);</p>
  <p>Alters the file position, if possible, to correspond to the position stored
  in sp (as described below). Altering the file position performs as follows:</p>
  <p>1. if (om &amp; ios_base::out)!=0, then update the output sequence and
  write any unshift sequence;</p>
  <p>2. set the file position to sp;</p>
  <p>3. if (om &amp; ios_base::in)!=0, then update the input sequence;</p>
  <p>where om is the open mode passed to the last call to open(). The operation
  fails if is_open() returns false.</p>
