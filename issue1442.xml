Imposed happens-before edges should be in
synchronizes-with<BR/>
Each use of the words "happens-before" should be
replaced with the words "synchronizes-with" in the
following sentences:<BR/>
27.2.3p2<BR/>
30.3.1.2p6<BR/>
30.3.1.5p7<BR/>
30.6.4p7<BR/>
30.6.9p5<BR/>
30.6.10.1p23<BR/>
Rationale: Happens-before is defined in 1.10p11 in a way
that (deliberately) does not make it explicitly transitively
closed. Adding edges to happens-before directly, as in
27.2.3p2 etc., does not provide transitivity with
sequenced-before or any other existing happens-before
edge. This lack of transitivity seems to be unintentional.
