There are no requirements on the <tt>stateT</tt> template parameter of
<tt>fpos</tt> listed in 27.4.3. The interface appears to require that
the type be at least Assignable and CopyConstructible (27.4.3.1, p1),
and I think also DefaultConstructible (to implement the operations in
Table 88).
</p>
<p>
21.1.2, p3, however, only requires that
<tt>char_traits&lt;charT&gt;::state_type</tt> meet the requirements of
CopyConstructible types.
</p>
<p>

Additionally, the <tt>stateT</tt> template argument has no
corresponding typedef in fpos which might make it difficult to use in
generic code.

<resolution>
<p>
Modify 21.1.2, p4 from
</p>
<p>
    Requires: <tt>state_type</tt> shall meet the requirements of
              CopyConstructible types (20.1.3).
</p>
<p>
    Requires: state_type shall meet the requirements of Assignable
              (23.1, p4), CopyConstructible (20.1.3), and
              DefaultConstructible  (20.1.4) types.
</p>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG feels this is two issues, as indicated above. The first is
a defect---std::basic_fstream is unimplementable without these
additional requirements---and the proposed resolution fixes it.  The
second is questionable; who would use that typedef?  The class
template fpos is used only in a very few places, all of which know the
state type already.  Unless motivation is provided, the second should
be considered NAD.</p>
