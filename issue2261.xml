<title>Are containers required to use their '<tt>pointer</tt>' type internally?</title>

<p>
Is a container <tt>C</tt> only supposed to refer to allocated memory (blocks of
contiguous storage, nodes, etc.) through objects of type <tt>C::pointer</tt>
rather than <tt>C::value_type*</tt>?
</p>

<p>
I don't see anything explicitly requiring this, so a container could
immediately convert the result of <tt>get_allocator().allocate(1)</tt> to a
built-in pointer of type <tt>value_type*</tt> and only deal with the built-in
pointer until it needs to deallocate it again, but that removes most
of the benefit of allowing allocators to use custom pointer types.
