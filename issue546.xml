<p>
The TR sneaks in two new integer types, _Longlong and _Ulonglong, in [tr.c99].
The rest of the TR should use that type.  I believe this affects two places.
First, the random number requirements, 5.1.1/10-11, lists all of the types with
which template parameters named IntType and UIntType may be instantiated.
_Longlong (or "long long", assuming it is added to C++0x) should be added to the
IntType list, and UIntType (again, or "unsigned long long") should be added to
the UIntType list.  Second, 6.3.2 lists the types for which hash&lt;&gt; is
required to be instantiable. _Longlong and _Ulonglong should be added to that
list, so that people may use long long as a hash key.

We are not going to fix TR1.

<p>
The paper "long long goes to the library" addresses the integration of
long long into the C++0x library.

Move to NAD.
