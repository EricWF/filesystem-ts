<p>
Section 22.2.2.1.2 at p7 states that "A length specifier is added to
the conversion function, if needed, as indicated in Table 56."
However, Table 56 uses the term "length modifier", not "length
specifier".
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
In 22.2.2.1.2 at p7, change the text "A length specifier is added ..."
to be "A length modifier is added ..."
</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>C uses the term "length modifier".  We should be consistent.</p>
