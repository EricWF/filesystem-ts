<title>min() and max() functions should be std::binary_functions</title>
<section><sref ref="[alg.min.max]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Both std::min and std::max are defined as template functions.  This
is very different than the definition of std::plus (and similar
structs) which are defined as function objects which inherit
std::binary_function.<br/>
<br/>
        This lack of inheritance leaves std::min and std::max somewhat useless in standard library algorithms which require
a function object that inherits std::binary_function.</p>

<rationale>
<p>Although perhaps an unfortunate design decision, the omission is not a defect
in the current standard.&nbsp; A future standard may wish to consider additional
function objects.</p>
