<p><b>Addresses DE-22, CH-15</b></p>
<p>
With the final acceptance of move operations as special
members and introduction of corresponding suppression
rules of implicitly generated copy operations the some
library types that were copyable in C++03 are no longer
copyable (only movable) in C++03, among them <tt>queue</tt>,
<tt>priority_queue</tt>, and <tt>stack</tt>.

Accepting <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3112.pdf">n3112</a> should fix this.

<p>
The only open issue in CH 15 with respect to the concurrency group
was the treatment of <tt>atomic_future</tt>. Since we removed <tt>atomic_future</tt>
in Batavia, I think all that remains is to remove the open issue from 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3112.pdf">N3112</a> and adopt it.
