<p><b>Addresses UK 172</b></p>

<p>
This issue is a response to NB comment UK-172
</p>

<p>
The functions <tt>quick_exit</tt> and <tt>at_quick_exit</tt> should be
added to the required features of <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> in a
freestanding implementation.
</p>

<p>
This comment was rejected in Summit saying neither <tt>at_exit</tt> nor
<tt>at_quick_exit</tt> should be required.  This suggests the comment was
misread, as <tt>atexit</tt> is already required to be supported.  If the LWG
really did wish to not require the registration functions be supported,
then a separate issue should be opened to change the current standard.
</p>

<p>
Given both <tt>exit</tt> and <tt>atexit</tt> are required, the UK panel feels it is
appropriate to require the new <tt>quick_exit</tt> facility is similarly
supported.
