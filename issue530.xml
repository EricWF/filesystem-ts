<title>Must elements of a string be contiguous?</title>
<section><sref ref="[basic.string]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Issue <iref ref="69"/>, which was incorporated into C++03, mandated
   that the elements of a vector must be stored in contiguous memory.
   Should the same also apply to <tt>basic_string</tt>?</p>

<p>We almost require contiguity already. Clause <sref ref="[multiset]"/>
  defines <tt>operator[]</tt> as <tt>data()[pos]</tt>. What's missing
  is a similar guarantee if we access the string's elements via the
  iterator interface.</p>

<p>Given the existence of <tt>data()</tt>, and the definition of
  <tt>operator[]</tt> and <tt>at</tt> in terms of <tt>data</tt>,
  I don't believe it's possible to write a useful and standard-
  conforming <tt>basic_string</tt> that isn't contiguous. I'm not
  aware of any non-contiguous implementation. We should just require
  it.

<resolution>
<p>Add the following text to the end of <sref ref="[basic.string]"/>,
paragraph 2. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The characters in a string are stored contiguously, meaning that if
  <tt>s</tt> is a <tt>basic_string&lt;charT, Allocator&gt;</tt>, then
  it obeys the identity
  <tt>&amp;*(s.begin() + n) == &amp;*s.begin() + n</tt>
  for all <tt>0 &lt;= n &lt; s.size()</tt>.
  </p>

<p>
Not standardizing this existing practice does not give implementors more
freedom.  We thought it might a decade ago.  But the vendors have spoken
both with their implementations, and with their voice at the LWG
meetings.  The implementations are going to be contiguous no matter what
the standard says.  So the standard might as well give string clients
more design choices.
