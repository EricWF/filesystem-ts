<sref ref="[locale.cons]"/> p14 ends with:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"[&hellip;] If <tt>f</tt> is null, the resulting object is a copy of <tt>other</tt>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
but the next line p15 says: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<i>Remarks:</i> The resulting locale has no name."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But both can't be true when <tt>other</tt> has a name and <tt>f</tt> is null.
<p/>
I've tried it on two implementations (MSVC,GCC) and they are inconsistent with each other on this.

Daniel Kr&uuml;gler:
<p/>
As currently written, the <i>Remarks</i> element applies unconditionally for all cases and thus should
"win". The question arises whether the introduction of this element by LWG <iref ref="424"/> had actually intended
to change the previous <i>Note</i> to a <i>Remarks</i> element. In either case the wording should be improved
to clarify this special case.
