<p><b>Addresses GB-96</b></p>
<p>
The function templates 'hash', 'less' and 'equal_to' are
important customization points for user-defined types to
be supported by several standard containers. These are
accessed through the &lt;functional&gt; header which has
grown significantly larger in C++0x, exposing many more
facilities than a user is likely to need through there own
header, simply to declare the necessary specialization.
There should be a smaller header available for users to
make the necessary customization.
</p>

<resolution>
Provide a tiny forwarding header for important
functor types in the &lt;functional&gt; header that a
user may want to specialize. This should contain
the template declaration for 'equal_to', 'hash' and
'less'.
