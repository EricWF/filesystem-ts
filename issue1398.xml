<p><b>Addresses GB-96</b></p>
<p>
The function templates <tt>hash</tt>, <tt>less</tt> and <tt>equal_to</tt>
are important customization points for user-defined types to
be supported by several standard containers. These are
accessed through the <tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt> header which has
grown significantly larger in C++0x, exposing many more
facilities than a user is likely to need through there own
header, simply to declare the necessary specialization.
There should be a smaller header available for users to
make the necessary customization.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Provide a tiny forwarding header for important
functor types in the <tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt> header that a
user may want to specialize. This should contain
the template declaration for <tt>equal_to</tt>, <tt>hash</tt> and
<tt>less</tt>.
