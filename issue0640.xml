<title>27.6.2.5.2 does not handle <tt>(unsigned) long long</tt></title>

<p>
The arithmetic inserters are described in <sref ref="[ostream.inserters.arithmetic]"/>.
Although the section starts with a listing of the inserters including
the new ones:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
operator&lt;&lt;(long long val );
operator&lt;&lt;(unsigned long long val );
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
the text in paragraph 1, which describes the corresponding effects
of the inserters, depending on the actual type of val, does not
handle the types <tt>long long</tt> and <tt>unsigned long long</tt>.
</p>

<note>
Alisdair: In addition to the (unsigned) long long problem, that whole paragraph
misses any reference to extended integral types supplied by the
implementation - one of the additions by core a couple of working papers
back.

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[ostream.inserters.arithmetic]"/>/1 change the third sentence
</p>

<blockquote><p>
When val is of type <tt>bool</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>unsigned
long</tt>, <ins>long long, unsigned long long,</ins> <tt>double</tt>,
<tt>long double</tt>, or <tt>const void*</tt>, the formatting conversion
occurs as if it performed the following code fragment:
