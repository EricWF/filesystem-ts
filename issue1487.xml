Clock related operations are currently not required not to
throw. So "Throws: Nothing." is not always true.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Either require clock related operations not to throw
(in 20.10) or change the Throws clauses in 30.3.2.
Also possibly add a note that abs_time in the past
or negative rel_time is allowed.
</resolution>
