Clock related operations are currently not required not to
throw. So "Throws: Nothing." is not always true.

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote>
Either require clock related operations not to throw
(in 20.10) or change the Throws clauses in 30.3.2.
Also possibly add a note that <tt>abs_time</tt> in the past
or negative <tt>rel_time</tt> is allowed.
