<title>Impossible container requirements for adaptor types</title>
<section><sref ref="[container.adaptors]"/></section>

<p>
The <tt>stack</tt> class template does not have an member type <tt>iterator</tt>, and therefore instantiations do not 
meet the general container requirements as described in <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>. But 
<sref ref="[container.adaptors.general]"/> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The headers <tt>&lt;queue&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;stack&gt;</tt> define the container adaptors <tt>queue</tt>, 
<tt>priority_queue</tt>, and <tt>stack</tt>. These container adaptors meet the requirements for sequence containers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Since sequence containers is a subset of general containers, this imposes requirements on the container adaptors that
are not satisfied.
</p>

<u>Daniel Kr&uuml;gler</u>: The wording change was performed as an editorial reorganization as requested
by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3296.html#GB116">GB 116</a> occuring first in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf">N3242</a>, as a side-effect it 
does now make the previous implicit C++03 classification to [lib.sequences]/1 more obvious. As the NB comment
noticed, the adaptors really are not sequences nor containers, so this wording needs to be fixed.
The most simple way to realize that is to strike the offending sentence.

<note>
Daniel adds concrete wording.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3376.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[container.adaptors.general]"/> p1 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- The headers <tt>&lt;queue&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;stack&gt;</tt> define the container adaptors <tt>queue</tt>, 
<tt>priority_queue</tt>, and <tt>stack</tt>. <del>These container adaptors meet the requirements for sequence containers.</del>
