<p>
<sref ref="[thread.condition.condvar]"/>: the specification for <tt>wait_for</tt>
with no predicate has an effects clause that says it calls <tt>wait_until</tt>,
and a returns clause that sets out in words how to determine the return
value. Is this description of the return value subtly different from the
description of the value returned by <tt>wait_until</tt>? Or should the effects
clause and the returns clause be merged?

I believe that <iref ref="859"/> (currently Ready) addresses this issue, and
that this issue should be marked NAD, solved by <iref ref="859"/> (assuming
it moves to WP).
