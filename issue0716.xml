<blockquote>
<p>
The following productions within the ECMAScript grammar are modified as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
CharacterClass ::
[ [lookahead &notin; {^}] ClassRanges ]
[ ^ ClassRanges ]
</pre></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
This definition for <tt>CharacterClass</tt> appears to be exactly identical to that in ECMA-262.
</p>

<p>
Was an actual modification intended here and accidentally omitted, or was this production accidentally included?

<blockquote>
<p>
We agree that what is specified is identical to what ECMA-262 specifies.
Pete would like to take a bit of time to assess whether we had intended,
but failed, to make a change.
It would also be useful to hear from John Maddock on the issue.

<p>
Move to Open.
