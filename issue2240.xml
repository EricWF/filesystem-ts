<p>
All usages of "function scope" in <sref ref="[thread.condition.condvar]"/> and <sref ref="[thread.condition.condvarany]"/>, 
such as <sref ref="[thread.condition.condvar]"/> p10 b4:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
If the function exits via an exception, lock.lock() shall be called prior to exiting the <strong>function scope</strong>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
seem to be inappropriate compared to the actual core language definition of <sref ref="[basic.funscope]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Labels (6.1) have function scope and may be used anywhere in the function in which they are declared. <strong>Only
labels have function scope</strong>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Probably the intended meaning is "outermost block scope of the function".
