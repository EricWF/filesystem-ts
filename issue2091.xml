<sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/>&#47;4 says, in part, 
</p><blockquote><p>
"<i>Requires</i>: If the tick period of [the argument] is not exactly 
convertible &hellip; [it] shall be rounded up &hellip;"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This doesn't belong in the requires clause. It's an effect. It belongs in paragraph 5. 
Nitpickingly, this would be a technical change: as written it imposes an obligation on 
the caller, while moving it imposes an obligation on the callee. Although that's certainly 
not what was intended.

Peter Dimov comments:
<p/>
Not to mention that it should round down, not up. :-)
<p/>
Incidentally, I see that the wrong <tt>try_lock</tt> requirement that the caller shall not own 
the mutex has entered the standard, after all. Oh well. Let's hope that the real world 
continues to ignore it.

<p>
Remove the offending sentence from the requirements clause. Do <em>not</em> add it back 
anywhere else. The implementation already must have license to wake up late, so the 
rounding is invisible.
<p/>
Move to Review.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to the N3337.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/>&#47;4 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
-3- The expression <tt>m.try_lock_for(rel_time)</tt> shall be well-formed and have the following semantics:
<p/>
-4- <i>Requires</i>: <del>If the tick period of <tt>rel_time</tt> is not exactly convertible to the native tick period, the
duration shall be rounded up to the nearest native tick period.</del> If <tt>m</tt> is of type <tt>std::timed_mutex</tt>,
the calling thread does not own the mutex.
</p></blockquote>
