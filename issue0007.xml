<p>Use of the term a 'non-privileged' process.
The comment for available in the struct space_info refers to: free space available to a
non-privileged process.
This seems quite specific to a POSIX implementation (on Windows, for instance, the
equivalent data would be user-specific but not directly related to privilege)</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Remove the comment and add a note to 15.32 [fs.op.space]:
[Note: the precise meaning of available space is implementation dependent. --end note]</p>
</resolution>
