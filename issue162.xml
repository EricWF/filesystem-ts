<title>Really &quot;formatted input functions&quot;?</title>

<p>It appears to be somewhat nonsensical to consider the functions
defined in the paragraphs 1 to 5 to be &quot;Formatted input
function&quot; but since these functions are defined in a section
labeled &quot;Formatted input functions&quot; it is unclear to me
whether these operators are considered formatted input functions which
have to conform to the &quot;common requirements&quot; from <sref ref="[istream.formatted.reqmts]"/>: If this is the case, all manipulators, not just
<tt>ws</tt>, would skip whitespace unless <tt>noskipws</tt> is set
(... but setting <tt>noskipws</tt> using the manipulator syntax would
also skip whitespace :-)</p>

<p>See also issue <iref ref="166"/> for the same problem in formatted
output</p>
