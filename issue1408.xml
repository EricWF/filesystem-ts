<p><b>Addresses GB-103</b></p>

The precondition to calling declare_no_pointers is that no
bytes in the range "have been previously registered" with
this call. As written, this precondition includes bytes in
ranges, even after they have been explicitly unregistered
with a later call to 'undeclare_no_pointers'.

<resolution>
Replace "have been previously registered" with
"are currently registered"
</resolution>

</issue>
