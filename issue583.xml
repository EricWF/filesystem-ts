<p>
There is no div() function for unsigned integer types.
</p>
<p>
There are several possible resolutions.  The simplest one is noted below.  Other
possibilities include a templated solution.

<resolution>
<p>
Add to 26.7 [lib.c.math] paragraph 8:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct udiv_t div(unsigned, unsigned);
struct uldiv_t div(unsigned long, unsigned long);
struct ulldiv_t div(unsigned long long, unsigned long long);
</pre></blockquote>

</resolution>

<rationale>
Toronto:  C99 does not have these unsigned versions because
the signed version exist just to define the implementation-defined behavior
of signed integer division.  Unsigned integer division has no implementation-defined
behavior and thus does not need this treatment.
