<discussion>
<p>
Paragraph 2 begins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The size of the state is r.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, the next sentence specifies a total of r+1 items in the textual
representation of the state,  r specific x's as well as a specific carry.
This makes a total of r+1 items that constitute the size of the state,
rather than r.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
We recommend the sentence be corrected to match:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
 The size of the state is r+1.
</p></blockquote>

<note>
Jens:  I plead for "NAD" on the grounds that "size of state" is only
used as an argument for big-O complexity notation, thus
constant factors and additions don't count.

<note>
Berlin: N1932 adopts the proposed NAD.
