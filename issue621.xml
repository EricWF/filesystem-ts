<title>non-const copy assignment operators of helper arrays</title>

        <p>

The computed and  "fill" assignment operators of <code>valarray</code>
helper     array     class    templates     (<code>slice_array</code>,
<code>gslice_array</code>,         <code>mask_array</code>,        and
<code>indirect_array</code>) are const  member functions of each class
template     (the     latter    by     the     resolution    of  <iref ref="123"/>
since  they have reference  semantics and thus do  not affect
the state of  the object on which they are  called.  However, the copy
assignment  operators  of  these  class  templates,  which  also  have
reference semantics,  are non-const.   The absence of  constness opens
the door to speculation about whether they really are intended to have
reference semantics (existing implementations vary widely).

Pre-Kona, Martin adds:

<p>
I realized that adding the const qualifier to the
functions as I suggested would break the const correctness of the
classes. A few possible solutions come to mind:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the const qualifier to the return types of these functions.</li>
<li>Change the return type of all the functions to void to match
the signatures of all the other assignment operators these classes
define.</li>
<li>Prohibit the copy assignment of these classes by declaring the
copy assignment operators private (as is done and documented by
some implementations).</li>
</ol>

<resolution>
        <p>

Declare  the  copy  assignment  operators  of all  four  helper  array
class templates const.

        </p>
        <p>

Specifically,  make the following edits:

        </p>
        <p>

Change     the    signature     in     <sref ref="[template.slice.array]"/>    and
<sref ref="[slice.arr.assign]"/> as follows:

        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>

<code><ins>const</ins> slice_array&amp; operator= (const slice_array&amp;)<ins> const</ins>;</code>

        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>

Change     the     signature     in    <sref ref="[template.gslice.array]"/>     and
<sref ref="[gslice.array.assign]"/> as follows:

        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>

<code><ins>const</ins> gslice_array&amp; operator= (const gslice_array&amp;)<ins> const</ins>;</code>

        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>

Change the  signature in <sref ref="[template.mask.array]"/>  and <sref ref="[mask.array.assign]"/> as
follows:

        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>

<code><ins>const</ins> mask_array&amp; operator= (const mask_array&amp;)<ins> const</ins>;</code>

        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>

Change     the     signature     in    <sref ref="[template.indirect.array]"/> and
<sref ref="[indirect.array.assign]"/> as follows:

        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>

<code><ins>const</ins> indirect_array&amp; operator= (const indirect_array&amp;)<ins> const</ins>;</code>

        </pre></blockquote>
</resolution>

<note>
Kona (2007) Added const qualification to the return types and set to Ready.
