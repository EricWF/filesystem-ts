<title>Library Intro refers to global functions that aren't global</title>

<discussion>
<p>The library had many global functions until 17.4.1.1 [lib.contents]
paragraph 2 was added: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>All library entities except macros, operator new and operator
delete are defined within the namespace std or namespaces nested
within namespace std. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It appears "global function" was never updated in the following: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>17.4.4.3 - Global functions [lib.global.functions]<br/>
<br/>
-1- It is unspecified whether any global functions in the C++ Standard
Library are defined as inline (dcl.fct.spec).<br/>
<br/>
-2- A call to a global function signature described in Clauses
lib.language.support through lib.input.output behaves the same as if
the implementation declares no additional global function
signatures.*<br/>
<br/>
    [Footnote: A valid C++ program always calls the expected library
    global function. An implementation may also define additional
    global functions that would otherwise not be called by a valid C++
    program. --- end footnote]<br/>
<br/>
-3- A global function cannot be declared by the implementation as
taking additional default arguments.&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
17.4.4.4 - Member functions [lib.member.functions]<br/>
<br/>
-2- An implementation can declare additional non-virtual member
function signatures within a class: </p>

  <blockquote>

<p>-- by adding arguments with default values to a member function
signature; The same latitude does not extend to the implementation of
virtual or global functions, however. </p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>     Change "global" to &quot;global or non-member&quot; in:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>17.4.4.3 [lib.global.functions] section title,<br/>
  17.4.4.3 [lib.global.functions] para 1,<br/>
  17.4.4.3 [lib.global.functions] para 2 in 2 places plus 2 
           places in the footnote,<br/>
  17.4.4.3 [lib.global.functions] para 3,<br/>
  17.4.4.4 [lib.member.functions] para 2</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>
Because operator new and delete are global, the proposed resolution
was changed from &quot;non-member&quot; to &quot;global or non-member.
</p>
</rationale>
</issue>
