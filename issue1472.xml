<p><b>Addresses US-171</b></p>

The atomic_init definition "Non-atomically assigns the
value" is not quite correct, as the atomic_init purpose is
initialization.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Change "Non-atomically assigns the value desired
to *object." with "Initializes *object with value
desired". Add the note: "[Note: This function
should only be applied to objects that have been
default constructed. These semantics ensure
compatibility with C. --end note]"
</resolution>
