<title>Bug in insert range in associative containers</title>

<discussion>
<p>Table 69 of Containers say that a.insert(i,j) is linear if [i, j) is ordered. It seems
impossible to implement, as it means that if [i, j) = [x], insert in an associative
container is O(1)!</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>N+log (size()) if [i,j) is sorted according to value_comp()</p>
