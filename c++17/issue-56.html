<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>We have two primary concerns with the interface as specified: </p>
<p>(a) its interface repeats the mistake of V7 Unix in 1979 by exposing access 
checking (and similarly file creation) independently from opening and mutating 
the file, and </p>
<p>(b) it provides no realistic means of testing a software library which uses 
the standard interface for accessing the filesystem under fault scenarios. </p>
<p>Due to the extent of (a), TOCTTOU [1] security vulnerabilities are 
guaranteed, if not during access checking[2], during other common operations 
such as temporary file creation[3]. </p>
<p>Due to (b) it is impossible to portably test libraries using the proposed 
interface against critical correctness and security edge cases. </p>

<p><i>[Beman Dawes: 10 Feb 2014: Suggested response: NAD, Future]</i> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We share your concerns and look forward to receiving specific proposals to 
  address them. Whether they will addressed by a revision of TS 18822 or a new 
  TS will be decided as proposals progress through the committee process. See
  <a href="http://isocpp.org/std/submit-a-proposal">How To Submit a Proposal</a>.
