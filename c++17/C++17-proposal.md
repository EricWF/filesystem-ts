Adopt the File System TS for C++17
==================================

Introduction
------------

The *File System Technical Specification*, ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015, was completed by the C++ committee in July 2014, and published by ISO in July 2015. There are three shipping implementations and one more soon-to-be shipped. This document proposes adopting the technical content of the File System TS for C++17.

### Abstract for the Technical Specification

>ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 specifies requirements for implementations of an interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may use to perform operations on file systems and their components, such as paths, regular files, and directories. This Technical Specification is applicable to information technology systems that can access hierarchical file systems, such as those with operating systems that conform to the POSIX (3) interface. This Technical Specification is applicable only to vendors who wish to provide the interface it describes.
