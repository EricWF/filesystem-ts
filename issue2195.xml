<p>
The requirement expressed in <sref ref="[re.results]"/> p2
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class template <tt>match_results</tt> shall satisfy the requirements of an allocator-aware container and of a
sequence container, as specified in <sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>, except that only operations defined for 
const-qualified sequence containers are supported.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
can be read to require the existence of the described constructors from as well, but they do not exist in the
synopsis. 
<p/>
The missing sequence constructors are: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
match_results(initializer_list&lt;value_type&gt;);
match_results(size_type, const value_type&amp;);
template&lt;class InputIterator&gt; match_results(InputIterator, InputIterator);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The missing allocator-aware container constructors are:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
match_results(const match_results&amp;, const Allocator&amp;);
match_results(match_results&amp;&amp;, const Allocator&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It should be clarified, whether (a) constructors are an exception of above mentioned operations or (b) whether
at least some of them (like those accepting a <tt>match_results</tt> value and an allocator) should be added.
<p/>
As visible in several places of the standard (including the core language), constructors seem usually to be considered 
as "operations" and they certainly can be invoked for const-qualified objects.
<p/>
The below given proposed resolution applies only the minimum necessary fix, i.e. it excludes constructors from
above requirement.

<p>
Check current implementations to see what they do and, possibly, write a paper.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3376.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[re.results]"/> p2 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class template <tt>match_results</tt> shall satisfy the requirements of an allocator-aware container and of a
sequence container, as specified in <sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>, except that only operations defined for 
const-qualified sequence containers <ins>that are not constructors</ins> are supported.
