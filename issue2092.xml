<p>
<sref ref="[thread.condition.condvarany]"/>&#47;4 says, in part, that 
<tt>condition_variable_any()</tt> throws an exception 
"if any native handle type manipulated is not available". 
<p/>
I don't know what that means. Is this intended to say something different 
from the analogous words for <tt>condition_variable()</tt> [<sref ref="[thread.condition.condvar]"/>&#47;4], 
"if some non-memory resource limitation prevents initialization"? If not, 
it should be worded the same way.
