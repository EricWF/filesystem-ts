<title>Missing preconditions for regex_token_iterator c'tors</title>

<p>
The text provided in <sref ref="[re.tokiter.cnstr]"/>/2+3 describes
the effects of the three non-default constructors of class
template regex_token_iterator but is does not clarify which values
are legal values for submatch/submatches. This becomes
an issue, if one takes <sref ref="[re.tokiter]"/>/9 into account, which explains
the notion of a "current match" by saying:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The <i>current match</i> is <tt>(*position).prefix()</tt> if <tt>subs[N]
== -1</tt>, or <tt>(*position)[subs[N]]</tt> for any other value of
<tt>subs[N]</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It's not clear to me, whether other negative values except -1
are legal arguments or not - it seems they are not.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Add the following precondition paragraph just before the current
<sref ref="[re.tokiter.cnstr]"/>/2:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> Each of the initialization values of <tt>subs</tt> must be <tt>&gt;= -1</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
</resolution>
