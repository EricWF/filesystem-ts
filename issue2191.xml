<sref ref="[re.results.const]"/>/3: "Move-constructs an object of class <tt>match_results</tt> satisfying the same 
postconditions as Table 141."
</p>
<p>
Table 141 lists various member functions and says that their results should be the results of the corresponding member 
function calls on <tt>m</tt>. But <tt>m</tt> has been moved from, so the actual requirement ought to be based on the 
value that <tt>m</tt> had <em>before</em> the move construction, not on <tt>m</tt> itself.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the requirements for the copy constructor should refer to Table 141.
<p/>

<p/>
Also, the requirements for move-assignment should refer to Table 141. Further it seems as if in Table 141 all phrases of
"for all integers <tt>n &lt; m.size()</tt>" should be replaced by "for all <em>unsigned</em> integers 
<tt>n &lt; m.size()</tt>".
