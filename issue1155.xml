<p><b>Addresses FR 38</b></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>What is ISO/IEC 1990:9899/DAM
        1? My guess is that's a typo for ISO/IEC
        9899/Amd.1:1995 which I'd
        have expected to be referenced here (the tables
        make reference to things
        which were introduced by Amd.1).</p>
<p><b>Suggestion</b></p>
        <p>One need probably a reference
        to the document which introduce <tt>char16_t</tt> and
        <tt>char32_t</tt> in C (ISO/IEC TR 19769:2004?).</p>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>Create issue. Document in question should be C99, not C90+amendment1. The 
    rest of the section requires careful review for completeness. Example &lt;cstdint&gt; 
    <sref ref="[cstdint.syn]"/>. Assign to C liasons.</p>
