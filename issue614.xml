<title>std::string allocator requirements still inconsistent</title>

<p>
This is based on N2134, where 21.3.1/2 states:
"... The Allocator object used shall be a copy of the Allocator object 
passed to the basic_string object's constructor or, if the constructor does 
not take an Allocator argument, a copy of a default-constructed Allocator 
object."
</p>
<p>
Section 21.3.2/1 lists two constructors:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
basic_string(const basic_string&lt;charT,traits,Allocator&gt;&amp; str );

basic_string(const basic_string&lt;charT,traits,Allocator&gt;&amp; str ,
             size_type pos , size_type n = npos,
             const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
and then says "In the first form, the Allocator value used is copied from 
str.get_allocator().", which isn't an option according to 21.3.1.
</p>
<note>
Batavia:  We need blanket statement to the effect of:
</note>

<ol>
<li>If an allocator is passed in, use it, or,</li>
<li>If a string is passed in, use its allocator.</li>
</ol>
<note>
Review constructors and functions that return a string; make sure we follow these
rules (substr, operator+, etc.).  Howard to supply wording.

<note>
Bo adds:  The new container constructor which takes only a <tt>size_type</tt> is not
consistent with <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>, p9 which says in part:

<blockquote>
All other constructors for these container types take an
<tt>Allocator&amp;</tt> argument (20.1.2), an allocator whose value type
is the same as the container's value type. A copy of this argument is
used for any memory allocation performed, by these constructors and by
all member functions, during the lifetime of each container object.

post Bellevue: We re-confirm that the issue is real. Pablo will provide wording.
