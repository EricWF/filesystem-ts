<title>Member open vs. flags</title>

<discussion>
<p>The description of basic_istream&lt;&gt;::open leaves unanswered questions about how it
responds to or changes flags in the error status for the stream. A strict reading
indicates that it ignores the bits and does not change them, which confuses users who do
not expect eofbit and failbit to remain set after a successful open. There are three
reasonable resolutions: 1) status quo 2) fail if fail(), ignore eofbit 3) clear failbit
and eofbit on call to open(). </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[ifstream.members]"/> paragraph 3, <i>and</i> in <sref ref="[ofstream.members]"/> paragraph 3, under open() effects, add a footnote:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A successful open does not change the error state.</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>This may seem surprising to some users, but it's just an instance
of a general rule: error flags are never cleared by the
implementation. The only way error flags are are ever cleared is if
the user explicitly clears them by hand.</p>

<p>The LWG believed that preserving this general rule was
important enough so that an exception shouldn't be made just for this
one case.  The resolution of this issue clarifies what the LWG
believes to have been the original intent.</p>
