<discussion>
There is no reason for the offsetof macro to invoke
potentially throwing operations, so the result of
noexcept(offsetof(type,member-designator)) should be
true.

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

</discussion>

<resolution>
Add to the end of 18.2p4:<BR/>
"No operation invoked by the offsetof macro shall
throw an exception, and
noexcept(offsetof(type,member-designator)) shall
be true."
</resolution>

</issue>
