<p>
Clause 21.4.1 [string.require]p3 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
No <tt>erase()</tt> or <tt>pop_back()</tt> member function shall throw
any exceptions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However in 21.4.6.5 [string::erase] p2 the first version of <tt>erase</tt> has
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Throws</i>: <tt>out_of_range</tt> if <tt>pos > size()</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<note>2011-03-24 Madrid meeting</note>

<p>
Beman: Don't want to just change this, can we just say "unless otherwise specified"?
<p/>
Alisdair: Leave open, but update proposed resolution to say something like "unless otherwise specified".
<p/>
General agreement that it should be corrected but not a stop-ship.
<p/>
Action: Update proposed wording for issue 2003 as above, but leave Open. 
</p>

<resolution>

3 No <del><tt>erase()</tt> or</del> <tt>pop_back()</tt> member function

</resolution>
