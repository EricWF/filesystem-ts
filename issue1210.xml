p6 Iterator requirements <sref ref="[iterator.requirements]"/>
</p>

<blockquote>
An iterator <tt>j</tt> is called reachable from an iterator <tt>i</tt> if and only if
there is a finite sequence of applications of the expression <tt>++i</tt> that
makes <tt>i == j</tt>. If <tt>j</tt> is reachable from <tt>i</tt>, they refer to the same
container.
</blockquote>

<p>
A good example would be stream iterators, which do not refer to a
container.  Typically, the end iterator from a range of stream iterators
will compare equal for many such ranges.  I suggest striking the second
sentence.
</p>

<p>
An alternative wording might be:
</p>

<blockquote>
If <tt>j</tt> is reachable from <tt>i</tt>, and both <tt>i</tt> and
<tt>j</tt> are dereferencable iterators, then they refer to the same
range.

Change <sref ref="[iterator.requirements]"/>, p6:
</p>

<blockquote>
An iterator <tt>j</tt> is called <i>reachable</i> from an iterator
<tt>i</tt> if and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of

<tt>j</tt> is reachable from <tt>i</tt>, they refer to the same
