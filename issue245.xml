<title>Which operations on <tt>istream_iterator</tt> trigger input operations?</title>

<discussion>
<p>I do not think the standard specifies what operation(s) on istream
iterators trigger input operations.  So, for example:</p>

<pre>
        istream_iterator&lt;int&gt; i(cin);

        int n = *i++;
</pre>

<p>I do not think it is specified how many integers have been read
from cin.  The number must be at least 1, of course, but can it be 2?
More?</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>The standard is clear as written: the stream is read every time
operator++ is called, and it is also read either when the iterator is
constructed or when operator* is called for the first time.  In the
example above, exactly two integers are read from cin.</p>

<p>There may be a problem with the interaction between istream_iterator
and some STL algorithms, such as find.  There are no guarantees about
how many times find may invoke operator++.</p>
