<sref ref="[time.duration.cast]"/>/3:

<blockquote>
.... All intermediate computations shall be
carried out in the widest possible representation... .
</blockquote>

<p>
So ignoring
floating-point types for the moment, all this arithmetic has to be done
using the implementation's largest integral type, even if both arguments
use int for their representation. This seems excessive. And it's not at
all clear what this means if we don't ignore floating-point types.

This issue is related to <iref ref="952"/>.

<p>
The intent of this remark is that intermediate computations are carried out
using:

<blockquote><pre>
common_type&lt;typename ToDuration::rep, Rep, intmax_t&gt;::type
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The Remark was intended to be clarifying prose supporting the rather algorithmic description
of the previous paragraph.  I'm open to suggestions.  Perhaps the entire paragraph
3 (Remarks) would be better dropped?

We view this as a specific case of issue <iref ref="952"/>,
and should be resolved when that issue is resolved.

Move to NAD.
