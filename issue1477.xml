<p><b>Addresses GB-135</b></p>

The first sentence of <sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/> p.23 was changed by n2992 but
now makes no sense: "that is, return <tt>false</tt> while leaving
the contents of memory pointed to by <tt>expected</tt> before the
operation is the same that same as that of the <tt>object</tt> and
the same as that of <tt>expected</tt> after the operation."
There's a minor editorial difference between n2992 ("is
that same as that" vs "is the same that same as that") but
neither version makes sense.
Also, the remark talks about "<tt>object</tt>" which should
probably be "<tt>object</tt> or <tt>this</tt>" to cover the member functions
which have no object parameter.
