<p><b>Addresses GB-135</b></p>

The first sentence of 29.6p23 was changed by n2992 but
now makes no sense: "that is, return <tt>false</tt> while leaving
the contents of memory pointed to by expected before the
operation is the same that same as that of the object and
the same as that of expected after the operation."
There's a minor editorial difference between n2992 ("is
that same as that" vs "is the same that same as that") but
neither version makes sense.
Also, the remark talks about "object" which should
probably be "object or <tt>this</tt>" to cover the member functions
which have no object parameter.
