<discussion>
The order specifications are incomplete because the non-_explicit
functions do not have such parameters.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Add a new sentence: "If the program does not
specify an order, it shall be
memory_order_seq_cst." Or perhaps: "The non-_explicit
non-member functions shall affect
memory as though they were _explicit with
memory_order_seq_cst."
</resolution>
