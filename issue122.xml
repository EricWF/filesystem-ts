<title>streambuf/wstreambuf description should not say they are specializations</title>
<section><sref ref="[streambuf]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Section 27.5.2 describes the streambuf classes this way: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The class streambuf is a specialization of the template class basic_streambuf
specialized for the type char. </p>

<p>The class wstreambuf is a specialization of the template class basic_streambuf
specialized for the type wchar_t. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This implies that these classes must be template specializations, not typedefs. </p>

<p>It doesn't seem this was intended, since Section 27.5 has them declared as typedefs. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Remove <sref ref="[streambuf]"/> paragraphs 2 and 3 (the above two
sentences). </p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The <tt>streambuf</tt>  synopsis already has a declaration for the
typedefs and that is sufficient. </p>
</rationale>

</issue>
