<p>Equivalence is a volatile property.</p>

<p/><i>[Beman Dawes comments: 9 Feb 2014:]</i>

  <p/>For ideal operating systems populated by ideal external memory devices, we might be able to
  identify the specific functions that are subject to file system races. But this library needs to
  be useful across real operating system and external memory devices. In that environment, a blanket
  warning seems more appropriate. Operational functions [15 fs.op.funcs] introduction already concerns this warning:

  <blockquote>  <p/>[Note: Because hardware failures, network failures, file system races, and many other kinds of errors
occur frequently in file system operations, users should be aware that any filesystem operational
function, no matter how apparently innocuous, may encounter an error. See Error reporting. -- end note]
</blockquote>
  
Thus I see this issue as NAD. It is redundant to repeat this warning for a particular function.

<resolution>
<p>Consider adding a note that equivalence cannot be determined race-free.</p>
