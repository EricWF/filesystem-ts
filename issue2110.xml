<p>
<sref ref="[alg.remove]"/>&#47;p1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 <i>Requires</i>: The type of <tt>*first</tt> shall satisfy the <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements (Table 22).
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This means that <tt>remove</tt>&#47;<tt>remove_if</tt> can only use move assignment to permute the sequence. But then 
<sref ref="[alg.remove]"/>&#47;p6 (non-normatively) contradicts p1:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
6 <i>Note</i>: each element in the range <tt>[ret,last)</tt>, where <tt>ret</tt> is the returned value, has a valid 
but unspecified state, because the algorithms can eliminate elements by swapping with or moving from elements that 
were originally in that range.
</p></blockquote>

<note>2012, Kona</note>
<p>
Move to Ready.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair notes we could extend permission to use <tt>swap</tt> if it is available, but there
is no interest.  Accept the proposed resolution as written.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to the FDIS.</p>

<p>Change <sref ref="[alg.remove]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class ForwardIterator, class T&gt;
  ForwardIterator remove(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,
                         const T&amp; value);

template&lt;class ForwardIterator, class Predicate&gt;
  ForwardIterator remove_if(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last,
                            Predicate pred);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-6-<i>Note</i>: each element in the range <tt>[ret,last)</tt>, where <tt>ret</tt> is the 
returned value, has a valid but unspecified state, because the algorithms can eliminate 
elements by <del>swapping with or</del> moving from elements that were originally in that range.
