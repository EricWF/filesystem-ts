<title>Changes for [rand.req.eng]</title>

Section <sref ref="[rand.req.eng]"/> Random number engine requirements:
</p>

<p>
This change follows naturally from the proposed change to
<tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> in <iref ref="677"/>.
</p>

<p>
In table 104 the description of <tt>X(q)</tt> contains a special treatment of
the case <tt>q.size() == 0</tt>.  This is undesirable for 4 reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It replicates the functionality provided by <tt>X()</tt>.</li>
<li>It leads to the possibility of a collision in the state provided
    by some other <tt>X(q)</tt> with <tt>q.size() &gt; 0</tt>.</li>
<li>It is inconsistent with the description of the <tt>X(q)</tt> in
paragraphs <sref ref="[rand.eng.lcong]"/> p5, <sref
ref="[rand.eng.mers]"/> p8, and <sref ref="[rand.eng.sub]"/> p10 where
there is no special treatment of <tt>q.size() == 0</tt>.</li>
<li>The proposed replacement for <tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> given above
    allows for the case <tt>q.size() == 0</tt>.</li>
</ol>
