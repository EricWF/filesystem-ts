The <i>Remark</i> clauses newly  introduced into the Working Paper 
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2134.pdf">N2134</a>)
are  not mentioned  in  <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> where  we list  the
meaning  of <i>Effects</i>, <i>Requires</i>,  and other  clauses (with
the exception  of <i>Notes</i> which are documented  as informative in
<sref ref="[structure.summary]"/>, p2, and which they replace in many cases).

        </p>
        <p>

Propose add a bullet for <i>Remarks</i> along with a brief description.
