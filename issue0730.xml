<p>
If an engine adaptor is invoked with an argument of type <tt>seed_seq</tt>, then all base 
engines are specified to be seeded with this <tt>seed_seq</tt>. As <tt>seed_seq</tt>'s randomization method is 
qualified as constant, this procedure will ef fectively initialize all base engines with the same seed 
(though the resulting state might still dif fer to a certain degree if the engines are of different types). 
It is not clear whether this mode of operation is in general appropriate, hence -- as far as the 
stated requirements are of general nature and not just specific to the engine adaptors provided by 
the library -- it might be better to leave the behaviour unspecified, since the current definition of 
<tt>seed_seq</tt> does not allow for a generally satisfying specification.
