<sref ref="[string.capacity]"/>/8 specifies <tt>basic_string::resize(n, c)</tt> with:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects:</i> Alters the length of the string designated by <tt>*this</tt> as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
If <tt>n &lt;= size()</tt>, the function replaces the string designated by <tt>*this</tt> with a string of length <tt>n</tt> whose 
elements are a copy of the initial elements of the original string designated by <tt>*this</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
If <tt>n &gt; size()</tt>, the function replaces the string designated by <tt>*this</tt> with a string of length <tt>n</tt> whose 
first <tt>size()</tt> elements are a copy of the original string designated by <tt>*this</tt>, and whose remaining elements are all 
initialized to <tt>c</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This wording is a relic of the copy-on-write era. In addition to being extremely confusing, it has undesirable implications.  
Saying "replaces the string designated by <tt>*this</tt> with a string of length <tt>n</tt> whose elements are a copy" suggests 
that the trimming case can reallocate. Reallocation during trimming should be forbidden, like <tt>vector</tt>.
<p/>
At least 7 paragraphs are affected: <sref ref="[string.capacity]"/>/8, <sref ref="[string::append]"/>/9, 
<sref ref="[string::assign]"/>/3 and /10, <sref ref="[string::insert]"/>/11, <sref ref="[string::erase]"/>/4, and 
<sref ref="[string::replace]"/>/11 say "replaces the string [designated/controlled] by <tt>*this</tt>". (<sref ref="[string::copy]"/>/3 
is different &mdash; it "replaces the string designated by <tt>s</tt>".)
<p/>
Of the affected paragraphs, <tt>resize()</tt> and <tt>erase()</tt> are the most important to fix because they should forbid 
reallocation during trimming.
