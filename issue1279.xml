<p>
A program should not be allowed to add specialization of class templates
<tt>unary_function</tt> and <tt>binary_function</tt>, in force of <sref
ref="[namespace.std]"/>/1.
If a program were allowed to specialize these templates, the library could no
longer rely on them to provide the intended typedefs or there might be other
undesired interactions.

<blockquote><p>
Pete: Is this issue actually addressed by N3198, or did deprecating unary/binary_function?
<p/>
We determined that this issue is NOT resolved and that it must be resolved or else 
N3198 could break code that does specialize unary&frasl;binary function.
<p/>
Matt: don't move to NAD
<p/>
Howard: I suggest we go further and move 1279 to ready for Madrid.
<p/>
Group: Agrees move 1279 to ready for Madrid

Previous proposed resolution:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 The following <del>classes</del> <ins>class templates</ins> are provided to
simplify the typedefs of the argument and result types<del>:</del><ins>. A
program shall not declare specializations of these templates.</ins>
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
This meeting outcome was not properly reflected in the proposed resolution. I
also adapted the suggested wording to the N3242 numbering and content state.
During this course of action it turned out that the first suggested wording
change has already been applied.
