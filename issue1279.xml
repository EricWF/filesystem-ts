<p>
A program should not be allowed to add specialization of class templates
<tt>unary_function</tt> and <tt>binary_function</tt>, in force of <sref
ref="[namespace.std]"/>/1.
If a program were allowed to specialize these templates, the library could no
longer rely on them to provide the intended typedefs or there might be other
undesired interactions.
