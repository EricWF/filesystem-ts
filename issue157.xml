<title>Meaningless error handling for <tt>pword()</tt> and <tt>iword()</tt></title>

<p>According to paragraphs 2 and 4 of <sref ref="[ios.base.storage]"/>, the
functions <tt>iword()</tt> and <tt>pword()</tt> &quot;set the
<tt>badbit</tt> (which might throw an exception)&quot; on
failure. ... but what does it mean for <tt>ios_base</tt> to set the
<tt>badbit</tt>? The state facilities of the IOStream library are
defined in <tt>basic_ios</tt>, a derived class! It would be possible
to attempt a down cast but then it would be necessary to know the
character type used...</p>
