<p>
Table 16 of TR1 requires that all Pseudo Random Number generators have a
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
seed(integer-type s)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
member function that is equivalent to:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
mygen = Generator(s)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
But the generators <tt>xor_combine</tt> and <tt>discard_block</tt> have no such seed member, only the
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Gen&gt;
seed(Gen&amp;);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
member, which will not accept an integer literal as an argument: something that appears to violate the intent of Table 16.
</p>

<p>
So... is this a bug in TR1?
</p>

<p>
This is a real issue BTW, since the Boost implementation does adhere to the requirements of Table 16, while at least one commercial implementation does not and follows a strict adherence to sections 5.1.4.5 and 5.1.4.6 instead.

<blockquote><p>
Both engines do have the necessary
constructor, therefore the omission of the <tt>seed()</tt> member
functions appears to be an oversight.

<blockquote><p>
Recommend NAD: <tt>xor_combine</tt> does no longer exist and <tt>discard_block[_engine]</tt>
has now the required seed overload accepting a <tt>result_type</tt>, which shall be an
unsigned integral type.
