<p>
In 20.1.5, paragraph 5, the standard says that &quot;Implementors are
encouraged to supply libraries that can accept allocators that
encapsulate more general memory models and that support non-equal
instances.&quot; This is intended as normative encouragement to
standard library implementors.  However, it is possible to interpret
this sentence as applying to nonstandard third-party libraries.

<resolution>
<p>
In 20.1.5, paragraph 5, change &quot;Implementors&quot; to
&quot;Implementors of the library described in this International
Standard&quot;.
</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG believes the normative encouragement is already
sufficiently clear, and that there are no important consequences
even if it is misunderstood.</p>
