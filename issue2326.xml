<p>
<sref ref="[rand.req.genl]"/>/1 says: "Throughout this subclause 26.5, the effect of instantiating a template [...] that has a 
template type parameter named <tt>IntType</tt> is undefined unless the corresponding template argument is <i>cv</i>-unqualified 
and is one of <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>long long</tt>, <tt>unsigned short</tt>, <tt>unsigned int</tt>, 
<tt>unsigned long</tt>, or <tt>unsigned long long</tt>."  <sref ref="[rand.dist.uni.int]"/> specifies 
<tt>template&lt;class IntType = int> class uniform_int_distribution</tt>, so this forbids 
<tt>uniform_int_distribution&lt;char/signed char/unsigned char&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
I am not aware of anything in <tt>&lt;random&gt;</tt> that works with 16-bit integers but fails with 8-bit integers, so I suspect 
that <tt>IntType</tt> and <tt>UIntType</tt> could simply be extended to permit the <tt>char</tt> family. Alternatively, this 
change could be limited to <tt>uniform_int_distribution</tt> alone, where it is definitely safe. A <tt>&lt;random&gt;</tt> expert 
should decide which change is best.
