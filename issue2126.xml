<p>
 <sref ref="[thread.mutex.class]"/>&#47;3 says that the class mutex "shall satisfy all the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements (<sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements]"/>)". 
 <sref ref="[thread.mutex.class]"/> is part of <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements]"/>, so at the very least, this 
 requirement is recursive. But worse, there is nothing that says what "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements" refers to. For example, 
 the "<tt>Lockable</tt> requirements" section starts with "A type <tt>L</tt> meets the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements if &hellip;". There is no such 
 statement for "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements".
<p/>
Organizationally, paragraphs 1-26 in <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/> should probably be in a subclause with a name. 
(This is actually an ISO requirement, to avoid exactly this kind of ambiguous referencing) Then the first sentence of 
<sref ref="[thread.mutex.class]"/>&#47;3 can become a note: "The class mutex meets the requirements of (whatever)", since that 
subclause already says that the mutex types "shall meet the requirements set out in this section."
<p/>
And similarly for <sref ref="[thread.mutex.recursive]"/>&#47;2 (<tt>recursive_mutex</tt>).
<p/>
<sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.requirements]"/>, Timed mutex types, also needs the same rearrangement: its introductory 
requirements should be moved into a subclause, and the first sentences of <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.class]"/>&#47;2 
and <sref ref="[thread.timedmutex.recursive]"/>&#47;2 should be turned into notes that refer to this new subclause and 
to the new subclause in <sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/>.

<note>2012, Portland: move to Tentatively NAD Editorial</note>
<p>
Seems no real ambiguity. May need some reorg of text rather then changing the wording.
</p>
<p>
Is there much that needs to be changed? But Pete's suggestion of putting requirement in separate sub section is good.
Should be the direction to editor.
</p>
<p>
Suggest this is an editorial change. Happy with Pete's comments.
