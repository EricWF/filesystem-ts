In the spirit of <tt>printf vs iostream</tt>...
</p>

<p>
POSIX <tt>printf</tt> says that <tt>%'d</tt> should insert grouping characters (and the
implication is that in the absence of <tt>'</tt> no grouping characters are
inserted). The <tt>num_put</tt> facet, on the other hand, seems to always insert
grouping characters. Can this be considered a defect worth fixing for
C++0x? Maybe <tt>ios_base</tt> needs an additional flag?

I'm not sure it constitutes a defect, but I would be in favor of adding
another flag (and corresponding manipulator).

<blockquote>
I don't know if it qualifies as a defect but I agree that there
should be an easy way to control whether the thousands separator
should or shouldn't be inserted. A new flag would be in line with
the current design of iostreams (like <tt>boolalpha</tt>, <tt>showpos</tt>, or
<tt>showbase</tt>).

This is not a part of C99. LWG suggests submitting a paper may be appropriate.
