try_lock does not provide a guarantee of forward progress
because it is allowed to spuriously fail.
</discussion>

<resolution>
The standard mutex types must not fail spuriously
in try_lock. See <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3141.pdf">n3141</a> page 205 - Appendix 1 - Additional Details
