<title>does endl imply synchronization with the device?</title>
<section><sref ref="[ostream.manip]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>A footnote in <sref ref="[ostream.manip]"/> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    [Footnote: The effect of executing cout &lt;&lt; endl is to insert a 
     newline character in the output sequence controlled by cout, then 
     synchronize it with any external file with which it might be 
     associated. --- end foonote]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Does the term "file" here refer to the external device?
This leads to some implementation ambiguity on systems with fully 
buffered files where a newline does not cause a flush to the device.
</p>

<p>
Choosing to sync with the device leads to significant performance
penalties for each call to endl, while not sync-ing leads to
errors under special circumstances.
</p>

<p>
I could not find any other statement that explicitly defined
the behavior one way or the other.

<resolution>
<p>Remove footnote 300 from section <sref ref="[ostream.manip]"/>.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>We already have normative text saying what <tt>endl</tt> does: it
inserts a newline character and calls <tt>flush</tt>.  This footnote
is at best redundant, at worst (as this issue says) misleading,
because it appears to make promises about what <tt>flush</tt>
does.</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
