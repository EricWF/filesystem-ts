       <code>money_base::none</code> on <code>money_get</code>

       <p>

In paragraph 2, <sref ref="[locale.money.get.virtuals]"/> specifies the following:

       </p>
       <blockquote>

Where <code>space</code> or <code>none</code> appears in the format
pattern, except at the end, optional white space (as recognized
by <code>ct.is</code>) is consumed after any required space.

       </blockquote>
       <p>

This requirement can be (and has been) interpreted two mutually
exclusive ways by different readers. One possible interpretation
is that:

       </p>
       <blockquote>
           <ol>
               <li>

where <code>money_base::space</code> appears in the format, at least
one space is required, and

               </li>
               <li>

where <code>money_base::none</code> appears in the format, space is
allowed but not required.

               </li>
           </ol>
       </blockquote>
       <p>

The other is that:

       </p>
       <blockquote>

where either <code>money_base::space</code> or <code>money_base::none</code> appears in the format, white space is optional.

       </blockquote>

<p>
There is a noun missing from the proposed resolution. It's not clear
that the last sentence would be helpful, even if the word were not
missing:
</p>
<blockquote>
In either case, any required MISSINGWORD followed by all optional whitespace (as recognized by ct.is()) is consumed.

<p>
Strike this sentence and move to Review.

   <resolution>
       <p>

I propose to change the text to make it clear that the first
interpretation is intended, that is, to make following change to
<sref ref="[locale.money.get.virtuals]"/>, p2:

       </p>

       <blockquote>

When <code><ins>money_base::</ins>space</code>
or <code><ins>money_base::</ins>none</code> appears <ins>as the last
element </ins>in the format pattern, <del>except at the end, optional
white space (as recognized by <code>ct.is</code>) is consumed after
any required space.</del> <ins>no white space is consumed. Otherwise,
where <code>money_base::space</code> appears in any of the initial
elements of the format pattern, at least one white space character is
required. Where <code>money_base::none</code> appears in any of the
initial elements of the format pattern, white space is allowed but not
required.</ins>
If <code>(str.flags() &amp; str.showbase)</code> is <code>false</code>, ...
