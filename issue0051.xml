<p>
<tt>directory_iterator</tt> and <tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt> are constant iterators, but their
<tt>pointer</tt>/<tt>reference</tt> typedefs are wrong (<tt>std::iterator</tt> defaults to providing modifiable
ones).</p>

<p>
I noticed the same problem when trying to resolve <iref ref="52"/>. The currently suggested wording for that
issue should fix the here mentioned problem as well.
<p/>
I recommend to solve this issue as "Resolved by the proposed wording for <iref ref="52"/>".
