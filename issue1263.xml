requests rvalue swap overloads in a couple of places they
were missed.
</p>

<p>
We have in general reverted to the single swap signature taking lvalue
references, which could be seen as the alternative solution to
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n3009.html#UK314">UK 314</a>,
bringing consistency to the standard &lt;g&gt;
</p>

<p>
Either way, I no longer expect to see any work to resolve this comment -
the work is complete and it should be either marked Rejected, or
Accepted with Modifications (namely, removing all other rvalue swaps!)
