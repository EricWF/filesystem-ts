<p><b>Addresses US-205</b></p>
<p>
The third sentence says "If the invocation is not deferred,
a call to a waiting function on an asynchronous return
object that shares the associated asynchronous state
created by this async call shall block until the associated
thread has completed." The next sentence says "If the
invocation is not deferred, the <tt>join()</tt> on the created
thread..." Blocking until a thread completes is not
necessarily a join.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
Decide whether the requirement is to block until
finished or to call join, and rewrite to match.
