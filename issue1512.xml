<p>
<sref ref="[futures.async]"/> p. 3: The third sentence says 
"If the invocation is not deferred, a call to a waiting function 
on an asynchronous return object that shares the associated asynchronous state
created by this <tt>async</tt> call shall block until the associated
thread has completed." The next sentence says "If the
invocation is not deferred, the <tt>join()</tt> on the created
thread..." Blocking until a thread completes is not
necessarily a join.

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<p>
Decide whether the requirement is to block until
finished or to call join, and rewrite to match.
