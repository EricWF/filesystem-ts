To Do List

* old toc isn't correct, resulting in history not being correct.
* Apply editorial suggests from NB comments.
* Gray background italic text should not appear in the TS. Add div?
* References to "C++11" should be "C++std"? Front matter References needs changing. But coordinate with Fundamentals TS.
* After Issues fixes applied to TS, verify there are no remaining == 0 or != 0 that should be whatever::none.
* Editorial: in 4.2 the section-id [fs.def.cannonical-path] should be [fs.def.canonical-path] (Daniel K)
* Run inspect to verify no broken links, etc.
* Replace [, ec] notation with "respectively" notation. But ask first.
* const directory_entry& operator*() const;
  const directory_entry* operator->() const; are out-of-place in the directory_entry synopsis. They should be
  in with the observers. They have no descriptions and should be noexcept. Open an issue.
* Search WP for Throws: Nothing, open an issue. S/B noexcept.
