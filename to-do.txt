To Do List

* old toc isn't correct, resulting in history not being correct.
* Apply editorial suggests from NB comments.
* Gray background italic text should not appear in the TS. Add div?
* References to "C++11" should be "C++std"? Front matter References needs changing. But coordinate with Fundamentals TS.
* After Issues fixes applied to TS, verify there are no remaining == 0 or != 0 that should be whatever::none.
