To Do List

* old toc isn't correct, resulting in revision history not being correct on issues lists.
* Search WP for Throws: Nothing, open an issue. S/B noexcept.
* IE overflowing right margin slightly

* 2663. Enable efficient retrieval of file size from directory_entry. Pursue BGD's solution:
* Initial work-in-progress on an experimental branch to remove visible directory_entry cache access by permitting operational function implementations taking boost::filesystem::path& arguments to access private directory_entry cached data via friendship. Since directory_entry has an automatic conversion to const boost::filesystem::path&, users wishing to use the cached data should call operational functions with a directory_entry rather than a path.

Simple issues, ready to discuss
2665. remove_filename() post condition is incorrect
2667. path::root_directory() description is confusing
2674. Bidirectional iterator requirement on path::iterator is very expensive  
2669. recursive_directory_iterator effects refers to non-existent functions 
2671. Errors in Copy
2673. status() effects cannot be implemented as specified
2670. system_complete refers to undefined variable 'base'

More complex, ready to discuss
