To Do List

* old toc isn't correct, resulting in history not being correct.
* Replace [, ec] notation with "respectively" notation. But ask first.
* const directory_entry& operator*() const;
  const directory_entry* operator->() const; are out-of-place in the directory_entry synopsis. They should be
  in with the observers. They have no descriptions and should be noexcept. Open an issue.
* Search WP for Throws: Nothing, open an issue. S/B noexcept.
