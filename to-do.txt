To Do List

* Issues list cross-references still being generated with sg3- filenames. See "Issues 37, 38, 41, and 49 ..." for examples.

* Apply editorial suggests from NB comments.
* Gray background italic text should not appear in the TS. Add div?
* References to "C++11" should be "C++std". Front matter References needs changing.
* Issues lists says "Issues 37, 38, 41, and 49 are concerned with signatures which should or should not be noexcept. I will provide unified proposed wording for these issues, possibly in a separate paper."
