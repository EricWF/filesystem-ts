<p><b>Addresses US-197</b></p>

There is no defined synchronization between
promise::set_value and future::get.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Replace "[Note: and they synchronize and
serialize with other functions through the referred
associated asynchronous state. --end note]" with
the normative "They synchronize with (1.10) any
operation on a future object with the same
associated asynchronous state marked ready."
</resolution>
