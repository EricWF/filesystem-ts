<p>
<tt>copy_n()</tt> and <tt>uninitialized_copy_n()</tt> only return the output iterator, and not the input iterator. 
Likely the interface was simply copied from the original STL. Unfortunately the interface in the original STL contains a bug.
<p/>
<tt>copy_n()</tt> and <tt>uninitialized_copy_n()</tt> must return the resulting input iterator as well as the output 
iterator (I would suggest returning a pair). Without this, there is no way to continue reading from an actual input 
iterator &mdash; and if it is really a forward iterator, it will cost <tt>n</tt> increments to get back to where you were.
