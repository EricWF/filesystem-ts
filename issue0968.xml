<p><i>Change Exceptions <sref ref="[thread.req.exception]"/> as indicated:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some functions described in this Clause are 
specified to throw exceptions of type <code>system_error</code> (19.5.5). Such exceptions 
shall be thrown if any of the <i>Error conditions</i> are detected or a call to an operating system or other underlying API 
results in an error that prevents the library function from meeting its specifications.
<i>[Note:</i> See <sref ref="[res.on.exception.handling]"/> for exceptions thrown to report 
storage allocation failures. <i>&mdash;end 
note]</i></p>

<p><ins><i>[Example:</i></ins></p>

<blockquote>

<p><ins>Consider a function in this clause that is specified to throw exceptions of type <code>
system_error</code> and specifies <i>Error conditions</i> that include <code>
operation_not_permitted</code> for a thread that does not have the privilege to 
perform the operation. Assume that, during the execution of this function, an <code>errno</code> 
of <code>EPERM</code> is reported by a POSIX API call used by the 
implementation. Since POSIX specifies an <code>errno</code> of <code>EPERM</code> 
when &quot;the caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation&quot;, 
the implementation maps <code>EPERM</code>&nbsp; to an <code>error_condition</code> 
of <code>operation_not_permitted</code> (<sref ref="[syserr]"/>) and an exception of type <code>
system_error</code> is thrown. </ins></p>

the existing text above is shown with the changes proposed in issues 962 and 967. The
