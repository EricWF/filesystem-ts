<p>
27.4.4.2, p17 says
</p>

<blockquote><p>
-17- Before copying any parts of rhs, calls each registered callback
pair (fn,index) as (*fn)(erase_event,*this,index). After all parts but
exceptions() have been replaced, calls each callback pair that was
copied from rhs as (*fn)(copy_event,*this,index). 
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The name copy_event isn't defined anywhere. The intended name was
copyfmt_event.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Replace copy_event with copyfmt_event in the named paragraph.</p>
</resolution>
</issue>
