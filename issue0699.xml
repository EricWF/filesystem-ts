changes <tt>min/max</tt> in several places in random from member
functions to static data members. I believe this introduces
a needless backward compatibility problem between C++0X and
TR1. I'd like us to find new names for the static data members,
or perhaps change <tt>min/max</tt> to <tt>constexpr</tt>s in C++0X.
