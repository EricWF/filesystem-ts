<p><b>Addresses JP 23</b></p>

<p>
There is a freestanding implementation including
<tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;ratio&gt;</tt>, lately added to Table 13, C++ library headers.
Programmers think them useful and hope that these headers are also added
to Table 15, C++ headers for freestanding implementations, that shows
the set of headers which a freestanding implementation shall include at
least.
</p>

<p><b>Original proposed resolution</b></p>

<p>
Add <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;ratio&gt;</tt> to Table 15.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 The <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt> header has far too many dependencies to require for a
free-standing implementation.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>&lt;ratio&gt;</tt> header would be useful, has no dependencies, but is not
strictly necessary.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt> header is fundamentally a core language facility with a
library interface, so should be supported.
</p>

<p>
(it is anticipated the resolution will come via an update to paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2814.pdf">N2814</a>)
(see also LWG <iref ref="833"/>)

<blockquote>
<p>
Move this to NAD.
</p>
<p>
We considered all of the listed headers, and found a compelling case
only for the inclusion of <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt> in the list of headers required
of a freestanding implementation.
</p>
<p>
See Martin Tasker's paper 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2932.pdf">Fixing Freestanding</a>
which provides the wording to include <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt> into freestanding
implementations.

<resolution>
