<title>Closing an fstream should clear error state</title>
<section><sref ref="[ifstream.members]"/> <sref ref="[ofstream.members]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
A strict reading of <sref ref="[fstreams]"/> shows that opening or
closing a basic_[io]fstream does not affect the error bits.  This
means, for example, that if you read through a file up to EOF, and
then close the stream and reopen it at the beginning of the file,
the EOF bit in the stream's error state is still set.  This is
counterintuitive.
</p>
<p>
The LWG considered this issue once before, as issue <iref ref="22"/>,
and put in a footnote to clarify that the strict reading was indeed
correct.  We did that because we believed the standard was
unambiguous and consistent, and that we should not make architectural
changes in a TC.  Now that we're working on a new revision of the
language, those considerations no longer apply.

<resolution>

<p>Change <sref ref="[ifstream.members]"/>, para. 3 from:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Calls rdbuf()->open(s,mode|in). If that function returns a null pointer, calls setstate(failbit) (which may throw ios_base::failure [Footnote: (lib.iostate.flags)].
</p></blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Calls rdbuf()->open(s,mode|in). If that function returns a null pointer, calls setstate(failbit) (which may throw ios_base::failure [Footnote: (lib.iostate.flags)), else calls clear().
</p></blockquote>

<p>Change <sref ref="[ofstream.members]"/>, para. 3 from:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Calls rdbuf()->open(s,mode|out). If that function returns a null pointer, calls setstate(failbit) (which may throw ios_base::failure [Footnote: (lib.iostate.flags)).
</p></blockquote>

<note>Kona: the LWG agrees this is a good idea.  Post-Kona: Bill
provided wording.  He suggests having open, not close, clear the error
flags.</note>

<note>Post-Sydney: Howard provided a new proposed resolution.  The
  old one didn't make sense because it proposed to fix this at the
  level of basic_filebuf, which doesn't have access to the stream's
  error state.  Howard's proposed resolution fixes this at the level
  of the three fstream class template instead.</note>
