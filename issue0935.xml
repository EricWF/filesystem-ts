<title>clock error handling needs to be specified</title>
<section><sref ref="[time.clock]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
Each of the three clocks specified in Clocks <sref ref="[time.clock]"/>
provides the member function:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
static time_point now();
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The semantics specified by Clock requirements <sref ref="[time.clock.req]"/>
make no mention of error handling. Thus the function may throw <tt>bad_alloc</tt>
or an implementation-defined exception (<sref ref="[res.on.exception.handling]"/>
paragraph 4).
</p>

<p>
Some implementations of these functions on POSIX, Windows, and
presumably on other operating systems, may fail in ways only detectable
at runtime. Some failures on Windows are due to supporting chipset
errata and can even occur after successful calls to a clock's <tt>now()</tt>
function.
</p>

<p>
These functions are used in cases where exceptions are not appropriate
or where the specifics of the exception or cause of error need to be
available to the user. See
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2828.html">N2828</a>,
<i>Library Support for hybrid error
handling (Rev 1)</i>, for more specific discussion of use cases. Thus some change in
the interface of now is required.
</p>

<p>
The proposed resolution has been implemented in the Boost version of the
chrono library. No problems were encountered.

Mark as NAD future. Too late to make this change without having already

returning <tt>t1</tt> happens before (1.10) the call returning <tt>t2</tt> and
both of these calls happen before <tt>C1::time_point::max()</tt>.
