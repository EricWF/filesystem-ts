<title>Return of <tt>gcount()</tt> after a call to <tt>gcount</tt></title>

<p>It is not clear which functions are to be considered unformatted
input functions. As written, it seems that all functions in <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> are unformatted input functions. However, it does not
really make much sense to construct a sentry object for
<tt>gcount()</tt>, <tt>sync()</tt>, ... Also it is unclear what
happens to the <tt>gcount()</tt> if eg. <tt>gcount()</tt>,
<tt>putback()</tt>, <tt>unget()</tt>, or <tt>sync()</tt> is called:
These functions don't extract characters, some of them even
&quot;unextract&quot; a character. Should this still be reflected in
<tt>gcount()</tt>? Of course, it could be read as if after a call to
<tt>gcount()</tt> <tt>gcount()</tt> return <tt>0</tt> (the last
unformatted input function, <tt>gcount()</tt>, didn't extract any
character) and after a call to <tt>putback()</tt> <tt>gcount()</tt>
returns <tt>-1</tt> (the last unformatted input function
<tt>putback()</tt> did &quot;extract&quot; back into the
stream). Correspondingly for <tt>unget()</tt>. Is this what is
intended?  If so, this should be clarified. Otherwise, a corresponding
clarification should be used.</p>
