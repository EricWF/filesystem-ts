This paragraph says: Let bk = xmin+k&#183;&#948; for k = 0,...,n,
and wk = fw(bk +&#948;) for k = 0,...,n.
However I believe that fw(bk) would be far more desirable.
I strongly suspect that this is nothing but a type-o.

Change p10 to read:<BR/>
Let bk = xmin+k&#183;&#948; for k = 0,...,n, and wk = fw(bk)
for k = 0,...,n.
