<p>
In Section <sref ref="[stringbuf.virtuals]"/>, Table 90, the implication is that
the four conditions should be mutually exclusive, but they are not.
The first two cases, as written, are subcases of the third.</p>

<p>
As written, it is unclear what should be the result if cases 1 and 2
are both true, but case 3 is false.
</p>

</discussion>

<resolution>

<p>Rewrite these conditions as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  (which &amp; (ios_base::in|ios_base::out)) == ios_base::in
</p>

<p>
  (which &amp; (ios_base::in|ios_base::out)) == ios_base::out
</p>

<p>
  (which &amp; (ios_base::in|ios_base::out)) == 
(ios_base::in|ios_base::out)
   and way == either ios_base::beg or ios_base::end
</p>

<p>Otherwise</p>
</blockquote>

</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>It's clear what we wanted to say, we just failed to say it.  This
  fixes it.</p>
</rationale>
