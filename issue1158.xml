<title>Encouragement to use monotonic clock</title>

<p><b>Addresses UK 322, US 96</b></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>Not all systems
        can provide a monotonic clock. How are they expected to
        treat a _for function?</p>
<p><b>Suggestion</b></p>
        <p>Add at least a note explaining the intent
        for systems that do not support a monotonic clock.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>Create an issue, together with UK 96. Note that the specification as is 
    already allows a non-monotonic clock due to the word &#8220;should&#8221; rather than 
    &#8220;shall&#8221;. If this wording is kept, a footnote should be added to make the 
    meaning clear.</p>

<blockquote><p>
LWG 1158's proposed resolution replaces the ISO-specified normative term
"should" with "are encouraged but not required to", which presumably means the
same thing, but has no ISO normative status. The WD used the latter formulation
in quite a few non-normative places, but only three normative ones. I've changed
all the normative uses to "should".

<resolution>

<p><i>Change Timing specifications <sref ref="[thread.req.timing]"/> as indicated:</i></p>

<p>
The member functions whose names end in <tt>_for</tt> take an argument that
specifies a relative time. Implementations should use a monotonic clock to
measure time for these functions.  <ins>[<i>Note:</i> Implementations are not
required to use a monotonic clock because such a clock may be unavailable.
