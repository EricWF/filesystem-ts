TODO: Look at all cases of unconstrained rvalue ref parameters and check
that concept req'ts work when <tt>T</tt> deduced as reference.
</p>

<p>
 We found some instances where that was not done correctly and we figure
   the possibility of deducing <tt>T</tt> to be an lvalue reference was probably
   overlooked elsewhere.
