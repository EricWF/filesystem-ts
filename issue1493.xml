<p><b>Addresses US-189</b></p>

<tt>mutex</tt> and <tt>recursive_mutex</tt> should have an <tt>is_locked()</tt>
member function. <tt>is_locked</tt> allows a user to test a lock
without acquiring it and can be used to implement a lightweight
<tt>try_try_lock</tt>.

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>
<blockquote>
Add a member function:
<PRE>
bool is_locked() const;
</PRE>
to <tt>std::mutex</tt> and <tt>std::recursive_mutex</tt>. These
functions return true if the current thread would
not be able to obtain a mutex. These functions do
not synchronize with anything (and, thus, can
avoid a memory fence).
