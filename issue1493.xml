<p><b>Addresses US-189</b></p>

mutex and recursive_mutex should have an is_locked()
member function. is_locked allows a user to test a lock
without acquiring it and can be used to implement a lightweight
try_try_lock.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Add a member function:
<PRE>
bool is_locked() const;
</PRE>
to std::mutex and std::recursive_mutex. These
functions return true if the current thread would
not be able to obtain a mutex. These functions do
not synchronize with anything (and, thus, can
avoid a memory fence).
</resolution>
