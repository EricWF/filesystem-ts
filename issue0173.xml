<title>Inconsistent types for <tt>basic_filebuf::setbuf()</tt></title>

<p>
In <sref ref="[filebuf]"/> the function <tt>setbuf()</tt> gets an
object of type <tt>streamsize</tt> as second argument. However, in
<sref ref="[filebuf.virtuals]"/> paragraph 9 the second argument is of type
<tt>int</tt>.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can see this is not really a contradiction because
everything is consistent if <tt>streamsize</tt> is typedef to be
<tt>int</tt>. However, this is almost certainly not what was
intended. The same thing happened to <tt>basic_istream::ignore()</tt>,
as described in issue <iref ref="172"/>.

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[filebuf.virtuals]"/> paragraph 9, change all uses of
<tt>int</tt> in the description of <tt>setbuf()</tt> to
<tt>streamsize</tt>.</p>
</resolution>
