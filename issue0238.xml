<title>Contradictory results of stringbuf initialization.</title>
<section><sref ref="[stringbuf.cons]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>In 27.7.1.1 paragraph 4 the results of calling the constructor of
'basic_stringbuf' are said to be <tt>str() == str</tt>. This is fine
that far but consider this code:</p>

<pre>
  std::basic_stringbuf&lt;char&gt; sbuf("hello, world", std::ios_base::openmode(0));
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "'" &lt;&lt; sbuf.str() &lt;&lt; "'\n";
</pre>

<p>Paragraph 3 of 27.7.1.1 basically says that in this case neither
the output sequence nor the input sequence is initialized and
paragraph 2 of 27.7.1.2 basically says that <tt>str()</tt> either
returns the input or the output sequence. None of them is initialized,
ie. both are empty, in which case the return from <tt>str()</tt> is
defined to be <tt>basic_string&lt;cT&gt;()</tt>.</p>

<p>However, probably only test cases in some testsuites will detect this
"problem"...</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Remove 27.7.1.1 paragraph 4.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>We could fix 27.7.1.1 paragraph 4, but there would be no point.  If
we fixed it, it would say just the same thing as text that's already
in the standard.</p>
