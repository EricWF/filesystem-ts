<title>[PDTS] Filename length needs bullet item</title>
<section><sref ref="4.7 [fs.def.filename]]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Filename lengths are also implementation dependent. This is not the same as
FILENAME_MAX that specifies the maximum length of pathnames.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add a bullet: "Length of filenames."</p>

<h4>Proposed wording:</h4>

<p><i>[2014-02-07: Beman Dawes]</i></p>
<p>Change 4.7:</p>
  <p>The name of a file. Filenames dot&nbsp; 
and dot-dot&nbsp; have special meaning. The following characteristics of 
  filenames are operating system dependent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>The permitted characters. [<i>Example</i>: Some operating systems prohibit the ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1F) 
    in filenames. <i>--end example</i>].</p>
  </li>
  <li><ins>The maximum permitted length.</ins></li>
  <li>
  <p>Filenames that are not permitted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Filenames that have special meaning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Case awareness and sensitivity during path resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Special rules that may apply to file types other than regular 
  files, such as directories.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</resolution>
