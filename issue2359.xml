<p>
As discussed in <a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=35399">c++std-lib-35399</a> and its replies, 
I can see two possible interpretations of the effects of <tt>regex_constants::nosubs</tt>:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li><p>
The effect of <tt>nosubs</tt> only applies during matching. Parentheses are
still recognized as marking a sub-expression by the <tt>basic_regex</tt>
compiler, and <tt>basic_regex::mark_count()</tt> still returns the number of
marked sub-expressions, but anything they match is not stored in the
results. This means it is not always true that <tt>results.size() == r.mark_count() + 1</tt> 
for a successful match.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<tt>nosubs</tt> affects how a regular expression is compiled, altering the
state of the <tt>std::basic_regex</tt> object so that <tt>mark_count()</tt> returns
zero. This also affects any subsequent matching.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The definition of <tt>nosubs</tt> should make this clear.
<p/>
The wording in <sref ref="[re.synopt]"/>/1 seems to imply that <tt>nosubs</tt> only has
effects during matching, which is (1), but all known implementations
do (2). John Maddock confirmed that (2) was intended.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3797.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apply the following edit to the table in <sref ref="[re.synopt]"/>/1</p>

<blockquote><p>
Specifies that <ins>no sub-expressions shall be considered to be
marked, so that</ins> when a regular expression is matched against a character container
sequence, no sub-expression matches shall be stored in the supplied
<tt>match_results</tt> structure.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
