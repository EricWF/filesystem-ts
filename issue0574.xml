<title>DR 369 Contradicts Text</title>

<discussion>
<p>
lib.iostream.objects requires that the standard stream objects are never
destroyed, and it requires that they be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
DR 369 adds words to say that we really mean for ios_base::Init objects to force
construction of standard stream objects. It ends, though, with the phrase "these
stream objects shall be destroyed after the destruction of dynamically ...".
However, the rule for destruction is stated in the standard: "The objects are
not destroyed during program execution."

<resolution>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/>/1:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-2- The objects are constructed and the associations are established at
some time prior to or during the first time an object of class
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> is constructed, and in any case before the body of main
begins execution.<sup>290)</sup> The objects are not destroyed during program
execution.<sup>291)</sup> If a translation unit includes <tt>&lt;iostream&t;</tt> or explicitly
constructs an <tt>ios_base::Init</tt> object, these stream objects shall be
constructed before dynamic initialization of non-local objects defined
later in that translation unit<del>, and these stream objects shall be
destroyed after the destruction of dynamically initialized non-local
objects defined later in that translation unit</del>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<note>
Kona (2007): From <sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/>/2, strike the words "...and these stream objects
shall be destroyed after the destruction of dynamically initialized
non-local objects defined later in that translation unit." Proposed
Disposition: Review
