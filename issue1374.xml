20.2.1 Table 34 "MoveConstructible requirements" says
"Note: rv remains a valid object. Its state is unspecified".
Some components give stronger guarantees. For
example, moved-from <tt>shared_ptr</tt>s are guaranteed <tt>empty</tt>
(20.9.11.2.1/25).
In general, what the standard really should say (preferably
as a global blanket statement) is that moved-from objects
can be destroyed and can be the destination of an
assignment. Anything else is radioactive. For example,
containers can be "emptier than empty". This needs to be
explicit and required generally.
</p>
<p>
Note: The last time that one of us mentioned "emptier
than empty" (i.e. containers missing sentinel nodes, etc.)
the objection was that containers can store sentinel nodes
inside themselves in order to avoid dynamically allocating
them. This is unacceptable because
</p>
<p>
(a) it forces existing implementations (i.e. Dinkumware's, Microsoft's,
IBM's,  etc.) to change for no good reason (i.e. permitting more
operations on moved-from objects), and 
</p>
<p>
(b) it invalidates end-iterators when swapping containers. (The Working
Paper currently permits end-iterator invalidation, which we
consider to be wrong, but that's a separate argument. In
any event, <em>mandating</em> end-iterator invalidation is very
different from permitting it.)
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed in ballot comment
</note>
<p>
State as a general requirement that moved-from
objects can be destroyed and can be the
destination of an assignment. Any other use is
undefined behavior.
