<discussion>
The note in this paragraph says "unlike future, calling get
more than once on the same atomic_future object is well
defined and produces the result again." There is nothing
in future that says anything negative about calling get
more than once.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Remove this note, or add words to the
requirements for future that reflect what this note
says.
