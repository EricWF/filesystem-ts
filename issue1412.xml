<p>
Monotonic clocks are generally easy to provide on all
systems and are implicitely required by some of the library
facilities anyway.

<resolution>
<p>Make monotonic clocks mandatory.</p>
<p>Strike [time.clock.monotonic] 20.11.5.2/p2</p>
<blockquote>
<tt>2</tt> <del>The class <tt>monotonic_clock</tt> is conditionally supported.</del>
</blockquote>

<p>Change [thread.req.timing]30.2.4p2 accordingly</p>
<blockquote>
The member functions whose names end in <tt>_for</tt> take an argument that
specifies a relative time. Implementations should use a monotonic clock to
measure time for these functions. <del>[ Note: Implementations are not
required to use a monotonic clock because such a clock may not be available.
