Paper <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3128.html">n3128</a> addresses
this issue by replacing <tt>monotonic_clock</tt> with <tt>steady_clock</tt>, which is mandatory.

<p>Change <sref ref="[thread.req.timing]"/> p.2 accordingly</p>
<blockquote>
The member functions whose names end in <tt>_for</tt> take an argument that
specifies a relative time. Implementations should use a monotonic clock to
measure time for these functions. <del>[ <em>Note</em>: Implementations are not
required to use a monotonic clock because such a clock may not be available.
