<blockquote>
It's not clear which paragraph this refers to, I had to go to the
ballot comments where US-195 reveals it's para 8, which in the FCD
(N3092) says:
<blockquote>
 Accesses to the same associated asynchronous state conflict (1.10).
</blockquote>
<p>This is now para 10 in N3242:</p>
<blockquote>
 Accesses to the same shared state conflict (1.10).
