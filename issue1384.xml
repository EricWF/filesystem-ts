<discussion>
pack_arguments is poorly named. It does not reflect the
fact that it is a tuple creation function and that it forwards
arguments.

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

</discussion>

<resolution>
Rename pack_arguments to forward_as_tuple
throughout the standard.
</resolution>
