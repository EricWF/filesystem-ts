<p>"The signature with argument <tt>ec</tt> returns <tt>static_cast&lt;uintmax_t&gt;(-1)</tt> if an error
occurs.", one would expect that <b>both</b> signatures return that if an error occurs?</p>

<p>Clarify the Returns clause, and apply the same for every function that returns an
<tt>uintmax_t</tt> where applicable.</p>
  
 <note>2014-02-13 LWG/SG-3 Issaquah:</note>

  <p/>Discussion when around in circles for awhile, until someone suggested the reference was wrong,
  and that the issue applied to the previous function in the WP, 15.14 File size [fs.op.file_size].
  
  <p/>The NB Comment makes much more sense if it applies to file_size(), so the chair was directed
  to change the reference from 15.15 [fs.op.hard_lk_ct] to 15.14 [fs.op.file_size].
  
  <p/>The intent that file_size() is only meaningful for regular_files. Beman to strike the
  the static_cast, changing it to "Otherwise an error is reported.".
