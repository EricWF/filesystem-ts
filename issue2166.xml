<p>
Another similar issue to the <tt>operator&lt;</tt> vs greater in <tt>nth_element</tt> but not as direct occurs 
in <sref ref="[alg.heap.operations]"/>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
-1- A <em>heap</em> is a particular organization of elements in a range between two random access iterators 
<tt>[a,b)</tt>. Its two key properties are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no element greater than <tt>*a</tt> in the range and
</li>
<li><tt>*a</tt> may be removed by <tt>pop_heap()</tt>, or a new element added by <tt>push_heap()</tt>, in 
O(log(<tt>N</tt>)) time.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
As noted by Richard Smith, it seems that the first bullet should read:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<tt>*a</tt> is not less than any element in the range
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Even better the heap condition could be stated here directly, instead of leaving it unspecified, i.e.,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Each element at <tt>(a+2*i+1)</tt> and <tt>(a+2*i+2)</tt> is less than the element at <tt>(a+i)</tt>, 
if those elements exist, for <tt>i&gt;=0</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But may be that was may be intentional to allow other heap organizations?
