<sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/>&#47;11 says that prior unlock operations <em>synchronize with</em> <tt>m.lock()</tt>.
<p/>
<sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/>&#47;19 says that if <tt>m.try_lock()</tt> succeeds, prior unlock operations 
<em>synchronize with</em> the operation. 
<p/>
<sref ref="[thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]"/>&#47;25 says that <tt>m.unlock()</tt> <em>synchronizes with</em> subsequent 
successful lock operations. 
<p/>
Does the third requirement add anything to the first two? If not, it should probably be a non-normative note.

<note>2012, Portland: move to Tentatively NAD Editorial</note>
<p>
Agree that third note should be non-normative and adds nothing.
</p>
<p>
Seems An Editorial change, but does changing a normative to non-normative wording makes it a non-editorial change?
</p>
<p>
Ask the editor. If not editorial, then we will agree on the fix as removal of the third point,
then we will put it in ready state for Bristol.
