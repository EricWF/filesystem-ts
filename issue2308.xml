<title>Clarify container destructor requirements w.r.t. <tt>std::array</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
It has been suggested that Table 96 &mdash; "Container requirements" makes
confusing requirements for the destructor of <tt>std::array</tt>:
<p/>
"note: the destructor is applied to every element of <tt>a</tt>; all the memory is deallocated."
<p/>
Since <tt>std::array</tt> obtains no memory, there is none to deallocate,
arguably  making it unclear what the requirement means for <tt>std::array::~array()</tt>.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change in <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>, Table 96 &mdash; "Container requirements", 
the "Assertion/note/pre-/post-condition" for the expression "<tt>(&amp;a)-&gt;~X()</tt>" as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
note: the destructor is applied to every element of <tt>a</tt>; <del>all the</del><ins>any</ins> memory 
<ins>obtained</ins> is deallocated.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</resolution>
