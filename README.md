# File System Technical Specification (ISO/IEC 18822)

This is the Git repository for the ISO/IEC File System Technical Specification. It is
maintained by the C++ committee's Filesystem Study Group (aka SG-3) 

## Branches

latest sources, and the version of tools used to create them.

but never 'N' numbers.

*other branches* - Generally follow Vincent Driessen's Git Flow conventions.

<blockquote>
*doc directory* - The (often generated) documents.
