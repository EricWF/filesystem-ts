## File System Technical Specification (ISO/IEC 18822)

This is the Git repository for the ISO/IEC File System Technical Specification. It is
maintained by the C++ committee's Filesystem Study Group (aka SG-3) 

### Branches

**master** - SG-3 documents with their official committee 'N' numbers, their latest sources, and the version of tools used to create them.

**develop** - Draft documents, sources, and tools. Numbered documents may have 'D' numbers, but never 'N' numbers.

**other branches** - Generally follow Vincent Driessen's Git Flow conventions.

### Directories

#### Root directory

*Documents* - N numbered documents are the final versions, so their contents never change. D numbered documents are drafts whose contents may subsequently change.

*src directory* - The source code used to generate the documents.

*tools directory* - The tools used to generate the documents.

**README.md** - This markdown file.
