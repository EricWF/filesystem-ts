<p>
The <tt>throw_with_nested</tt> specification passes in its argument as
<tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> (perfect forwarding pattern), but then discusses
requirements on <tt>T</tt> without taking into account that <tt>T</tt> may
be an lvalue-reference type. It is also not clear in the
spec that <tt>t</tt> is intended to be perfectly forwarded.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Patch [except.nested] p6-7 to match the intent with regards to
requirements on <tt>T</tt> and the use of
<tt>std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t)</tt>.
