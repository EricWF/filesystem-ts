<p><b>Addresses US-84</b></p>

The throw_with_nested spec passes in its argument as
T&amp;&amp; (perfect forwarding pattern), but then discusses
requirements on T without taking into account that T may
be an lvalue-reference type. It is also not clear in the
spec that t is intended to be perfectly forwarded.

<resolution>
Patch 6-7 to match the intent with regards to
requirements on T and the use of
std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t).
