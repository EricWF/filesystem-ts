<title>Locale::combine should be const</title>
<section><sref ref="[locale.members]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>locale::combine is the only member function of locale (other than constructors and
destructor) that is not const. There is no reason for it not to be const, and good reasons
why it should have been const. Furthermore, leaving it non-const conflicts with 22.1.1
paragraph 6: &quot;An instance of a locale is immutable.&quot; </p>

<p>History: this member function originally was a constructor. it happened that the
interface it specified had no corresponding language syntax, so it was changed to a member
function. As constructors are never const, there was no &quot;const&quot; in the interface
which was transformed into member &quot;combine&quot;. It should have been added at that
time, but the omission was not noticed. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[locale]"/> and also in <sref ref="[locale.members]"/>, add 
&quot;const&quot; to the declaration of member combine: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>template &lt;class Facet&gt; locale combine(const locale&amp; other) const; </pre>
</blockquote>
</resolution>
