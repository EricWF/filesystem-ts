<title>[FCD] Improve interoperability between

<p><b>Addresses US-185</b></p>

Cooperate with WG14 to improve interoperability between
the C++0x and C1x threads APIs. In particular, C1x
mutexes should be conveniently usable with a C++0x
lock_guard. Performance overheads for this combination
should be considered.

<resolution>
Remove C++0x timed_mutex and
timed_recursive_mutex if that facilitates
development of more compatible APIs.
