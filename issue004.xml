<title>Basic_string size_type and difference_type should be implementation defined</title>

<discussion>
<p>In Morristown we changed the size_type and difference_type typedefs
for all the other containers to implementation defined with a
reference to <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>.  This should probably also have been
done for strings. </p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect.  [Originally classified as a defect, later
reclassified.]  basic_string, unlike the other standard library
template containers, is severely constrained by its use of
char_traits. Those types are dictated by the traits class, and are far
from implementation defined.</p>
