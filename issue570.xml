<title>Request adding additional explicit specializations of char_traits</title>
<section><sref ref="[char.traits]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
Currently, the Standard Library specifies only a declaration for template class
char_traits&lt;&gt; and requires the implementation provide two explicit
specializations: char_traits&lt;char&gt; and char_traits&lt;wchar_t&gt;. I feel the Standard
should require explicit specializations for all built-in character types, i.e.
char, wchar_t, unsigned char, and signed char.
</p>
<p>
I have put together a paper
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1985.htm">N1985</a>)
that describes this in more detail and
includes all the necessary wording.

Portland: Jack will rewrite
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1985.htm">N1985</a>
to propose a primary template that will work with other integral types.

<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest that Jack be asked about the status of his paper, and if it
is not forthcoming, the work-item be assigned to someone else. If no one
steps forward to do the paper before the next meeting, we propose to
make this NAD without further discussion. We leave this Open for now,
but our recommendation is NAD.
</p>
<p>
Note: the issue statement should be updated, as the Toronto comment has
already been resolved. E.g., char_traits specializations for char16_t
and char32_t are now in the working paper.

<blockquote>
Nobody has submitted the requested paper, so we move to NAD, as suggested by the decision at the last meeting.
