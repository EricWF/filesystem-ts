<title>24.1.5 contains unintended limitation for <tt>operator-</tt></title>

<p>
In 24.1.5 [lib.random.access.iterators], table 76 the operational
semantics for the expression "<tt>r -= n</tt>" are defined as "<tt>return r += -n</tt>".
This means, that the expression <tt>-n</tt> must be valid, which is not the case
for unsigned types.
</p>

<note>
Sydney: Possibly not a real problem, since difference type is required
to be a signed integer type. However, the wording in the standard may
be less clear than we would like.

<p>
This issue refers to a requirements table we have removed.
</p>
<p>
The issue might now relate to <sref ref="[random.access.iterators]"/> p5.
However, the rationale in the issue already recognises that the
<tt>difference_type</tt> must be signed, so this really looks NAD.

<p>
We agree with Alisdair's observations.

Move to NAD.

Need to look at again without concepts.

<p>
There was a question about this phrase in the discussion: "the
expression <tt>-n</tt> must be valid, which is not the case for unsigned types."
If <tt>n</tt> is an object of the iterator <tt>difference_type</tt> (eg <tt>ptrdiff_t</tt>), 
then it is never unsigned.

<blockquote><p>
The group reviewed the wording in the draft and agreed that <tt>n</tt> is of
difference type, the difference type is signed, and the current wording
is correct.  Moved to NAD.

<resolution>
<p>
To remove this limitation, I suggest to change the
operational semantics for this column to:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
    { Distance m = n;
      if (m >= 0)
        while (m--) --r;
      else
        while (m++) ++r;
      return r; }
</pre></blockquote>
