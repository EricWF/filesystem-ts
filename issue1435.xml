The complex number functions added for compatibility
with the C99 standard library are defined purely as a
cross-reference, with no hint of what they should return.
This is distinct from the style of documentation for the
functions in the earlier standard. In the case of the
inverse-trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, a
reasonable guess of the functionality may be made from
the name, this is not true of the cproj function, which
apparently returns the projection on the Reimann Sphere.
A single line description of each function, associated with
the cross-reference, will greatly improve clarity.
