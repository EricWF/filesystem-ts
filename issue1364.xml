<p>
It is not clear how <tt>exception_ptr</tt> is synchronized.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Make clear that accessing in different threads
multiple <tt>exception_ptr</tt> objects that all refer to the
same exception introduce a race.

<note>2011-03-08: Lawrence comments and drafts wording</note>

<p>I think fundamentally, this issue is NAD, but clarification would not hurt.</p>

<note>
<p>Proposed resolution</p>
<p>Add a new paragraph to <sref ref="[propagation]"/> after paragraph 6 as follows:</p>

<p><ins>
[<i>Note:</i> Exception objects have no synchronization requirements, and expressions 
using them may conflict (<sref ref="[intro.multithread]"/>). &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</ins></p>
