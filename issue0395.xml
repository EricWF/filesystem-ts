<title>inconsistencies in the definitions of rand() and random_shuffle()</title>
<section><sref ref="[c.math]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
In <sref ref="[c.math]"/>, the C++ standard refers to the C standard for the
definition of rand(); in the C standard, it is written that "The
implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the rand
function."
</p>

<p>
In <sref ref="[alg.random.shuffle]"/>, there is no specification as to
how the two parameter version of the function generates its random
value.  I believe that all current implementations in fact call rand()
(in contradiction with the requirement avove); if an implementation does
not call rand(), there is the question of how whatever random generator
it does use is seeded.  Something is missing.
</p>

</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
In [lib.c.math], add a paragraph specifying that the C definition of
rand shal be modified to say that "Unless otherwise specified, the
implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the rand
function."
</p>

<p>
In [lib.alg.random.shuffle], add a sentence to the effect that "In
the two argument form of the function, the underlying source of
random numbers is implementation defined. [Note: in particular, an
implementation is permitted to use <tt>rand</tt>.]
</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The original proposed resolution proposed requiring the
  two-argument from of <tt>random_shuffle</tt> to
  use <tt>rand</tt>. We don't want to do that, because some existing
  implementations already use something else: gcc
  uses <tt>lrand48</tt>, for example.  Using <tt>rand</tt> presents a
  problem if the number of elements in the sequence is greater than
  RAND_MAX.</p> 
</rationale>
