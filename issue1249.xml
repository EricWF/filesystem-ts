<p>
The basic_ios default ctor is required to leave the objects members
uninitialized (see below). The paragraph says the object must be
initialized by calling basic_ios::init() before it's destroyed by
I can't find a requirement that it be initialized before calling
any of the class other member functions. Am I not looking in the
right place or that an issue?

I agree, that your wording makes that clearer, but suggest to write
</p>

<blockquote>
... calling <tt>basic_ios::init<del>()</del></tt> before ...
</blockquote>

<p>
Doing so, I recommend to adapt that of <tt>ios_base();</tt> as well, where
we have:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Effects:</i> Each <tt>ios_base</tt> member has an indeterminate value
after construction. These members shall be initialized by calling
<tt>basic_ios::init</tt>. If an <tt>ios_base</tt> object is destroyed
before these initializations have taken place, the behavior is
undefined.

<blockquote><pre>
ios_base();
