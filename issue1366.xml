<p>
It is unclear how a user replacement function can
simultaneously satisfy the race-free conditions imposed in
this clause and query the new-handler in case of a failed
allocation with the only available, mutating interface
<tt>std::set_new_handler</tt>.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

Offer a non-mutating interface to query the current new-handler.
