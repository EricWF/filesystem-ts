<discussion>
It is unclear how a user replacement function can
simultaneously satisfy the race-free conditions imposed in
this clause and query the new-handler in case of a failed
allocation with the only available, mutating interface
std::set_new_handler.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Offer a non-mutating interface to query the current
new-handler.
</resolution>
