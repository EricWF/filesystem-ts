<p>
Related to <iref ref="951"/>.
</p>

<p>
<sref ref="[time.clock.req]"/> says that a clock's <tt>rep</tt> member is "an
arithmetic type or a class emulating an arithmetic type." What are the
requirements for such a type?

<p>
We recommend this issue be addressed in the context of providing concepts
for the entire <tt>thread</tt> header.
</p>
<p>
May resolve for now by specifying arithmetic types,
and in future change to <tt>ArithmeticLike</tt>.
However, Alisdair believes this is not feasible.
</p>
<p>
Bill disagrees.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to proposed wording.  Move to Open.
