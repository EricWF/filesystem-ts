<title>No definition of "Stable" for copy algorithms</title>

<discussion>

<p>
<sref ref="[algorithm.stable]"/> specified the meaning of "stable" when applied to 
the different types of algorithms. The second bullet says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&mdash; For the <i>remove</i> algorithms the relative order of the elements that are not removed is preserved.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
There is no description of what "stable" means for copy algorithms, even though the term is 
applied to <tt>copy_if</tt> (and perhaps others now or in the future). Thus, <tt>copy_if</tt> 
is using the term without a precise definition.

<p>This wording is relative to the FDIS.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <sref ref="[algorithm.stable]"/> p. 1 change as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
When the requirements for an algorithm state that it is “stable” without further elaboration, it means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For the <i>sort</i> algorithms the relative order of equivalent elements is preserved.</li>
<li>For the <i>remove</i> <ins>and <i>copy</i></ins> algorithms the relative order of the elements that are 
not removed is preserved.</li>
<li>For the <i>merge</i> algorithms, for equivalent elements in the original two ranges, the elements from the
first range precede the elements from the second range.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
