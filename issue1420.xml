<p><b>Addresses GB-115</b></p>

There is no mention of what happens if sz==size(). While
it obviously does nothing I feel a standard needs to say
this explicitly.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Express the semantics as pseudo-code similarly
to the way it is done for the copying overload that
follows (in p3). Include an else clause that does
nothing and covers the sz==size() case.
</resolution>
