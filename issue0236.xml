<title>ctype&lt;char&gt;::is() member modifies facet</title>
<section><sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The description of the <tt>is()</tt> member in paragraph 4 of <sref ref="[facet.ctype.char.members]"/> is broken: According to this description, the
second form of the <tt>is()</tt> method modifies the masks in the
<tt>ctype</tt> object. The correct semantics if, of course, to obtain
an array of masks. The corresponding method in the general case,
ie. the <tt>do_is()</tt> method as described in <sref ref="[locale.ctype.virtuals]"/> paragraph 1 does the right thing.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
  <p>Change paragraph 4 from</p>
    <blockquote><p>
    The second form, for all *p in the range [low, high), assigns
    vec[p-low] to table()[(unsigned char)*p].
    </p></blockquote>
  <p>to become</p>
    <blockquote><p>
    The second form, for all *p in the range [low, high), assigns
    table()[(unsigned char)*p] to vec[p-low].
  </p></blockquote>
