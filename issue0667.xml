<sref ref="[locale.money.get.virtuals]"/>, para 1 says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The result is returned as an integral value
stored in <tt>units</tt> or as a sequence of digits possibly preceded by a
minus sign (as produced by <tt>ct.widen(c)</tt> where <tt>c</tt> is '-' or in the range
from '0' through '9', inclusive) stored in <tt>digits</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The following
objection has been raised:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Some implementations interpret this to mean that a facet derived from
<tt>ctype&lt;wchar_t&gt;</tt> can provide its own member <tt>do_widen(char)</tt>
which produces e.g. <tt>L'@'</tt> for the "widened" minus sign, and that the
<tt>'@'</tt> symbol will appear in the resulting sequence of digits.  Other
implementations have assumed that one or more places in the standard permit the
implementation to "hard-wire" <tt>L'-'</tt> as the "widened" minus sign.  Are
both interpretations permissible, or only  one?
</p></blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Furthermore: if <tt>ct.widen('9')</tt> produces <tt>L'X'</tt> (a non-digit), does a
parse fail if a <tt>'9'</tt> appears in the subject string? [Plum ref _22263Y33]

Kona (2007): Bill and Dietmar to provide proposed wording.

post Bellevue: Bill adds:
</note>

<blockquote>
The Standard is clear that the minus sign stored in <tt>digits</tt> is <tt>ct.widen('-')</tt>.
The subject string must contain characters <tt>c</tt> in the set <tt>[-0123456789]</tt>
which are translated by <tt>ct.widen(c)</tt> calls before being stored in <tt>digits</tt>;
the widened characters are not relevant to the parsing of the subject string.

We agree with Bill's comment above,
in line with the first of the interpretations offered in the issue.
Move to NAD.
