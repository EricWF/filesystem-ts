<p>
Right now, C++0x doesn't have <tt>atomic&lt;float&gt;</tt>. We're thinking of adding
the words to support it for TR2 (note: that would be slightly
post-C++0x). If we need it, we could probably add the words.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proposed resolutions:</b> Using <tt>atomic&lt;FP&gt;::compare_exchange</tt> (weak or
strong) should be either:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
ill-formed, or
</li>
<li>
well-defined.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I propose Option 1 for C++0x for expediency. If someone wants to argue
for Option 2, they need to say what exactly they want <tt>compare_exchange</tt>
to mean in this case (IIRC, C++0x doesn't even assume IEEE 754).

<p>
Recommend NAD. C++0x does have <tt>std::atomic&lt;float&gt;</tt>, and both
<tt>compare_exchange_weak</tt> and <tt>compare_exchange_strong</tt> are well-defined in
this case. Maybe change the note in <sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/> paragraph 20 to:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[<i>Note:</i> The effect of the compare-and-exchange operations is
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
if (!memcmp(object,expected,sizeof(*object)))
    *object = desired;
else
    *expected = *object;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This may result in failed comparisons for values that compare equal if
the underlying type has padding bits or alternate representations of
the same value. <i>-- end note</i>]
