<p>
The first sentence of the Effects clause for <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt> seems
to be missing some words. I can't parse
</p>
<blockquote>
... for all non-null <tt>p</tt> referencing the argument is no longer declared reachable...
</blockquote>
<p>
I take it the intent is that <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt> should be called only
when there has been a corresponding call to <tt>declare_reachable</tt>. In
particular, although the wording seems to allow it, I assume that code
shouldn't call <tt>declare_reachable</tt> once then call <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt>
twice.
</p>
<p>
I don't know what "shall be live" in the Requires clause means.
</p>
<p>
In the final Note for <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt>, what does "cannot be
deallocated" mean? Is this different from "will not be able to collect"?
</p>

<p>
For the wording on nesting of <tt>declare_reachable</tt> and
<tt>undeclare_reachable</tt>, the words for locking and unlocking recursive
mutexes probably are a good model.

Nick: what does "shall be live" mean?

<p>
Hans: I can provide an appropriate cross-reference to the Project Editor
to clarify the intent.

<p>
In <sref ref="[util.dynamic.safety]"/>
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2670.htm">N2670</a>,
Minimal Support for Garbage Collection)
</p>
<p>
Add at the beginning, before paragraph 39
</p>

<blockquote>
A complete object is <i>declared reachable</i> while the number of calls
to <tt>declare_reachable</tt> with an argument referencing the object exceeds the
number of <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt> calls with pointers to the same complete
object.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change paragraph 42 (Requires clause for <tt>undeclare_reachable</tt>)
</p>

<blockquote>
If <tt>p</tt> is not null, <del><tt>declare_reachable(p)</tt> was previously called</del>
<ins>the complete object referenced by <tt>p</tt> shall have
been previously declared reachable</ins>, and shall
be live <ins>(<sref ref="[basic.life]"/>)</ins> from the time of the call until the last <tt>undeclare_reachable(p)</tt>
call on the object.
</blockquote>

<p>
Change the first sentence in paragraph 44 (Effects clause for
<tt>undeclare_reachable</tt>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Effects:</i> 
<del>Once the number of calls to
<tt>undeclare_reachable(p)</tt> equals the number of calls to
<tt>declare_reachable(p)</tt>
for all non-null <tt>p</tt> referencing
the argument is no longer declared reachable.  When this happens,
pointers to the object referenced by p may not be subsequently
dereferenced.</del>
<ins>
After a call to <tt>undeclare_reachable(p)</tt>, if <tt>p</tt> is not null and the object <tt>q</tt>
referenced by <tt>p</tt> is no longer declared reachable, then
dereferencing any pointer to <tt>q</tt> that is not safely derived
results in undefined behavior.
</ins> ...
</blockquote>

<p>
Change the final note:
</p>
<p>
[<i>Note:</i> It is expected that calls to <tt>declare_reachable(p)</tt>
will consume a small amount of memory<ins>, in addition to that occupied
by the referenced object, </ins> until the matching call to
<tt>undeclare_reachable(p)</tt> is encountered. <del>In addition, the
referenced object cannot be deallocated during this period, and garbage
collecting implementations will not be able to collect the object while
it is declared reachable.</del> Long running programs should arrange
that calls <ins>for short-lived objects</ins> are matched. <i>--end
note</i>]
