<title>Class <tt>ctype_byname&lt;char&gt;</tt> redundant and misleading</title>
<section><sref ref="[locale.codecvt]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Section <sref ref="[locale.codecvt]"/> specifies that
<tt>ctype_byname&lt;char&gt;</tt> must be a specialization of the <tt>ctype_byname</tt>
template.</p>

<p>It is common practice in the standard that specializations of class templates are only
mentioned where the interface of the specialization deviates from the interface of the
template that it is a specialization of. Otherwise, the fact whether or not a required
instantiation is an actual instantiation or a specialization is left open as an
implementation detail. </p>

<p>Clause 22.2.1.4 deviates from that practice and for that reason is misleading. The
fact, that <tt>ctype_byname&lt;char&gt;</tt> is specified as a specialization suggests that there
must be something &quot;special&quot; about it, but it has the exact same interface as the
<tt>ctype_byname</tt> template. Clause 22.2.1.4 does not have any explanatory value, is at best
redundant, at worst misleading - unless I am missing anything. </p>

<p>Naturally, an implementation will most likely implement <tt>ctype_byname&lt;char&gt;</tt> as a
specialization, because the base class <tt>ctype&lt;char&gt;</tt> is a specialization with an
interface different from the <tt>ctype</tt> template, but that's an implementation detail and need
not be mentioned in the standard. </p>

<rationale>
<p> The standard as written is mildly misleading, but the correct fix
is to deal with the underlying problem in the <tt>ctype_byname</tt> base class,
not in the specialization. See issue <iref ref="228"/>.</p>
