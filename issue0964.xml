<p>
The requirements for the constructor for <tt>condition_variable</tt> has several
error conditions, but the requirements for the constructor for
<tt>condition_variable_any</tt> has none. Is this difference intentional?

<blockquote><p>
Move to open, pass to Howard. If this is intentional, a note may be
helpful. If the error conditions are to be copied from
<tt>condition_variable</tt>, this depends on LWG <iref ref="965"/>.

<blockquote><p>
The original intention 
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2447.htm#ConditionVariablesWording">N2447</a>)
was to let the OS return whatever errors it was going to return, and for
those to be translated into exceptions, for both
<tt>condition_variable</tt> and <tt>condition_variable_any</tt>.  I have not
received any complaints about specific error conditions from vendors on
non-POSIX platforms, but such complaints would not surprise me if they surfaced.

<p>
We don't have throw clauses for condition variables.

This issue may be dependent on LWG <iref ref="1268"/>.

<p>
Leave open. Detlef will coordinate with Benjamin.
</p>
<p>
Consider merging LWG 964, <iref ref="966"/>, and <iref ref="1268"/> into a
single paper.
