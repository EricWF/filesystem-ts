<title>No requirement that standard streams be flushed</title>
<section><sref ref="[ios::Init]"/></section>

<p>
As currently formulated, the standard doesn't require that there 
is ever a flush of <tt>cout</tt>, etc.  (This implies, for example, that 
the classical hello, world program may have no output.)  In the 
current draft
(<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2798.pdf">N2798</a>),
there is a requirement that the objects 
be constructed before <tt>main</tt>, and before the dynamic 
initialization of any non-local objects defined after the 
inclusion of <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> in the same translation unit.  The only 
requirement that I can find concerning flushing, however, is in 
<sref ref="[ios::Init]"/>, where the destructor of the last 
<tt>std::ios_base::Init</tt> object flushes.  But there is, as far as I 
can see, no guarantee that such an object ever exists. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the wording in <sref ref="[iostreams.objects]"/> says that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The objects 
are constructed and the associations are established at some 
time prior to or during the first time an object of class 
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> is constructed, and in any case before the body 
of main begins execution.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In <sref ref="[ios::Init]"/>, however, as an 
effect of the constructor, it says that
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If <tt>init_cnt</tt> is zero, 
the function stores the value one in <tt>init_cnt</tt>, then constructs 
and initializes the objects <tt>cin</tt>, <tt>cout</tt>, <tt>cerr</tt>, <tt>clog</tt> 
<tt>wcin</tt>, <tt>wcout</tt>, <tt>wcerr</tt>, and <tt>wclog</tt>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>
which seems to forbid earlier 
construction. 
</p>

<p>
(Note that with these changes, the exposition only "<tt>static 
int init_cnt</tt>" in <tt>ios_base::Init</tt> can be dropped.) 
</p>
<p>
Of course, a determined programmer can still inhibit the 
flush with things like: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
new std::ios_base::Init ;       //  never deleted 
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
or (in a function): 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::ios_base::Init ensureConstruction ; 
//  ... 
exit( EXIT_SUCCESS ) ; 
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps some words somewhere to the effect that all 
<tt>std::ios_base::Init</tt> objects should have static lifetime 
would be in order.

Moved to Ready.  Some editorial changes are expected (in addition to the
proposed wording) to remove <tt>init_cnt</tt> from <tt>Init</tt>.

Change <sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/>/2:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
-2- The objects are constructed and the associations are established at
some time prior to or during the first time an object of class
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> is constructed, and in any case before the body
of main begins execution.<sup>292</sup> The objects are not destroyed
during program execution.<sup>293</sup>
<del>If a translation unit includes
<tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> or explicitly constructs an
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> object, these stream objects shall be
constructed before dynamic initialization of non-local objects defined
later in that translation unit.</del>
<ins>The results of including <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> in a translation
unit shall be as if <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> defined an instance of
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> with static lifetime. Similarly, the entire
program shall behave as if there were at least one instance of
<tt>ios_base::Init</tt> with static lifetime.</ins>
