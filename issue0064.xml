<discussion>
<p>27.6.1.2.3, paragraph 13, is ambiguous. It can be interpreted two
different ways, depending on whether the second sentence is read as an
elaboration of the first. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Replace <sref ref="[istream::extractors]"/>, paragraph 13, which begins
&quot;If the function inserts no characters ...&quot; with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the function inserts no characters, it calls
  <tt>setstate(failbit)</tt>, which may throw
  <tt>ios_base::failure</tt> (27.4.4.3). If it inserted no characters
  because it caught an exception thrown while extracting characters
  from <tt>sb</tt> and <tt>failbit</tt> is on in <tt>exceptions()</tt>
  (27.4.4.3), then the caught exception is rethrown. </p>
</blockquote>
