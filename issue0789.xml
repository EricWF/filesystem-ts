Non-controversial. Bill is right, but Fermilab believes that this is
easy to use badly and hard to use right, and so it should be removed
entirely. Got into TR1 by well defined route, do we have permission to
remove stuff? Should probably check with Jens, as it is believed he is
the originator. Broad consensus that this is not a robust engine
adapter.
