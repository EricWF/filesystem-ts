<p>
When issue <iref ref="1445"/> was resolved by adopting 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3168.htm">N3168</a>, it exposed the need to 
modify both overloads of <tt>basic_istream::seekg</tt> (by inserting "the function clears eofbit," after "except that"), 
but the fix applied to the text apparently forgets the second overload at <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> p43.
