<title>Issue on <tt>basic_istream::seekg</tt></title>

<p>
When issue <iref ref="1445"/> was resolved by adopting 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3168.htm">N3168</a>, it exposed the need to 
modify both overloads of <tt>basic_istream::seekg</tt> (by inserting "the function clears eofbit," after "except that"), 
but the fix applied to the text apparently forgets the second overload at <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> p43.
</p>

<note>2013-10-17: Daniel provides concrete wording</note>

<p>
It seems that the tiny sentence "SIMILARLY for 27.7.1.3/43 (<tt>seekg</tt>)." had been overlooked. I agree that the wording needs to be
applied here as well.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> p43 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
basic_istream&lt;charT,traits&gt;&amp; seekg(off_type off, ios_base::seekdir dir);
</pre><blockquote>
<p>
-43- <i>Effects:</i> Behaves as an unformatted input function (as described in 27.7.2.3, paragraph 1), except
that <ins>the function first clears <tt>eofbit</tt>,</ins> it does not count the number of characters extracted<ins>,</ins> 
and does not affect the value returned by subsequent calls to <tt>gcount()</tt>. [&hellip;]
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
