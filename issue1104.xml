<p>
With the rvalue reference changes in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2844.html">N2844</a>
<tt>basic_ios::move</tt> no longer has the most convenient signature:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void move(basic_ios&amp;&amp; rhs);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This signature should be changed to accept lvalues.  It does not need to be
overloaded to accept rvalues.  This is a special case that only derived clients
will see.  The generic <tt>move</tt> still needs to accept rvalues.

<p>
Tom prefers, on general principles, to provide both overloads.
Alisdair agrees.
</p>
<p>
Howard points out that there is no backward compatibility issue
as this is new to C++0X.
</p>
<p>
We agree that both overloads should be provided,
and Howard will provide the additional wording.
Move to Open.

<resolution>
<p>
Add a signature to the existing prototype in the synopsis of <sref ref="[ios]"/>
and in <sref ref="[basic.ios.members]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
<ins>void move(basic_ios&amp; rhs);</ins>
void move(basic_ios&amp;&amp; rhs);
</pre></blockquote>
</resolution>

</issue>
