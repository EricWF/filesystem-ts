<title>current_exception wording unclear about exception type</title>
<section><sref ref="[propagation]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Consider this code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>exception_ptr xp;</pre>
<pre>try {do_something(); }

catch (const runtime_error&amp; ) {xp = current_exception();}

...

rethrow_exception(xp);</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Say <code>do_something()</code> throws an exception object of type <code>
range_error</code>. What is the type of the exception object thrown by <code>
rethrow_exception(xp)</code> above? It must have a type of <code>range_error</code>; 
if it were of type <code>runtime_error</code> it still isn't possible to 
propagate an exception and the exception_ptr/current_exception/rethrow_exception 
machinery serves no useful purpose.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the current wording does not explicitly say that. Different 
people read the current wording and come to different conclusions. While it may 
be possible to deduce the correct type from the current wording, it would be 
much clearer to come right out and explicitly say what the type of the referred 
to exception is.

<p>
I don't like the proposed resolution of 829. The normative text is
unambiguous that the <tt>exception_ptr</tt> refers to the <em>currently handled
exception</em>. This term has a standard meaning, see <sref ref="[except.handle]"/>/8; this is the
exception that <tt>throw;</tt> would rethrow, see <sref ref="[except.throw]"/>/7.
</p>
<p>
A better way to address this is to simply add the non-normative example
in question as a clarification. The term <i>currently handled exception</i>
should be italicized and cross-referenced. A [<i>Note:</i> the currently
handled exception is the exception that a throw expression without an
operand (<sref ref="[except.throw]"/>/7) would rethrow. <i>--end note</i>] is also an option.

<resolution>

<p>
After <sref ref="[propagation]"/> , paragraph 7, add the indicated text:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>exception_ptr current_exception();</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Returns:</i> <code>exception_ptr</code> object that refers 
to the currently handled exception <ins>(<sref ref="[except.handle]"/>)</ins> or a copy of the currently handled 
exception, or a null <code>exception_ptr</code> object if no exception is being handled. If 
the function needs to allocate memory and the attempt fails, it returns an
<code>exception_ptr</code> object that refers to an instance of <code>bad_alloc</code>. 
It is unspecified whether the return values of two successive calls to
<code>current_exception</code> refer to the same exception object. 
[<i>Note:</i> that is, it 
is unspecified whether <code>current_exception</code>
creates a new copy each time it is called.
<i>-- end note</i>]
</p>

<p>
<i>Throws:</i> nothing.
</p>
