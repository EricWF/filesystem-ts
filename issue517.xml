<p>
The last two rows of Table 16 deal with the i/o requirements of an engine,
specifying that the textual representation of an engine's state,
appropriately formatted, constitute the engine's  external representation.
</p>
<p>
This seems adequate when an engine's type is known.  However, it seems
inadequate in the  context of generic code, where it becomes useful and
perhaps even necessary to determine an engine's type via input.
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
We therefore recommend that, in each of these two rows of Table 16, the
text "textual representation" be expanded so as to read "engine name
followed by the textual representation."

Berlin: N1932 considers this NAD. This is a QOI issue.
