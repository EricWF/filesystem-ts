<title>qsort and POD</title>

<p>
Section <sref ref="[alg.c.library]"/> describes bsearch and qsort, from the C
standard library. Paragraph 4 does not list any restrictions on qsort,
but it should limit the base parameter to point to POD.  Presumably,
qsort sorts the array by copying bytes, which requires POD.

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[alg.c.library]"/> paragraph 4, just after the declarations and
before the nonnormative note, add these words: "both of which have the
same behavior as the original declaration.  The behavior is undefined
unless the objects in the array pointed to by <i>base</i> are of POD
type."
</p>

<note>Something along these lines is clearly necessary.  Matt
  provided wording.</note>
