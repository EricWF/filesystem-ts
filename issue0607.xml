<p>
Short seed vectors of 32-bit quantities all result in different states. However
this is not true of seed vectors of 16-bit (or smaller) quantities.  For example
these two seeds
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
unsigned short seed = {1, 2, 3};
unsigned short seed = {1, 2, 3, 0};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
both pack to
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
unsigned seed = {0x20001, 0x3};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
yielding the same state.
