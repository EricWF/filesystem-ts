<title>Incorrect specification of return value for <tt>map&lt;&gt;::at()</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[map.access]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>
In [map.access]/9, the <i>Returns</i> clause for <tt>map&lt;Key, T&gt;::at(x)</tt> says 
that it returns "a reference to the element whose key is equivalent to <tt>x</tt>." That can't be right. 
The signature for <tt>at()</tt> says that its return type is <tt>T</tt>, but the elements 
of <tt>map&lt;Key, T&gt;</tt> have type <tt>pair&lt;const K, T&gt;</tt>.  (I checked [unord.map.elem] 
and found that its specification of <tt>at()</tt> is correct. This is a problem for <tt>map</tt> only.)

<resolution>
<p>
Change the wording in [map.access]/9 so it's identical to what we already say for <tt>operator[]</tt>, 
which is unambiguous and correct.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: A reference to the <del>element whose key is equivalent</del><ins><tt>mapped_type</tt> 
corresponding</ins> to <tt>x</tt><ins> in <tt>*this</tt></ins>.
