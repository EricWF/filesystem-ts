<p>
The content of this sub-clause is purely trying to describe in words the
effect of the requires clauses on these operations, now that we have
Concepts. As such, the description is more confusing than the signature
itself. The semantic for these functions is adequately covered in the
requirements tables in <sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/>.

<resolution>
<p>
Strike <sref ref="[multimap.modifiers]"/> entirely
(but do NOT strike these signatures from the class template definition!).
