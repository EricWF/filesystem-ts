<title>Undefined Expression in Input Iterator Note Title</title>

<discussion>
<p>1) In 24.1.1/3, the following text is currently present.</p>

<p>"Note: For input iterators, a==b does not imply ++a=++b (Equality does
not guarantee the substitution property or referential transparency)."</p>

<p>However, when in Table 72, part of the definition of ++r is given as:</p>

<p>"pre: r is dereferenceable.
post: any copies of the previous value of r are no longer required
either to be dereferenceable ..."</p>

<p>While a==b does not imply that b is a copy of a, this statement should
perhaps still be made more clear.</p>

<p>2) There are no changes to intended behaviour</p>

<p>
3) This Note should be altered to say "Note: For input iterators a==b,
when its behaviour is defined ++a==++b may still be false (Equality does
not guarantee the substitution property or referential transparency).</p>

<rationale>
<p>This is descriptive text, not normative, and the meaning is clear.</p>
