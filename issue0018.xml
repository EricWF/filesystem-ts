<discussion>
<p>In the list of num_get&lt;&gt; non-virtual members on page 22-23, the member
that parses bool values was omitted from the list of definitions of non-virtual
members, though it is listed in the class definition and the corresponding
virtual is listed everywhere appropriate. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add at the beginning of <sref ref="[facet.num.get.members]"/>
another get member for bool&amp;, copied from the entry in 
<sref ref="[locale.num.get]"/>.</p>
</resolution>

</issue>
