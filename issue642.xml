<title>Invalidated fstream footnotes in N2134</title>

<p>
The standard wording of N2134 has extended the 14882:2003(E)
wording for the ifstream/ofstream/fstream open function to fix
a long standing problem, see <iref ref="409"/>.
</p>

<p>
Now it's properly written as
</p>

<blockquote><p>
"If that function does not return a null pointer calls clear(),
otherwise
calls setstate(failbit)[..]"
</p></blockquote>

<p>
instead of the previous
</p>

<blockquote><p>
"If that function returns a null pointer, calls setstate(failbit)[..]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
While the old footnotes saying
</p>

<blockquote><p>
"A successful open does not change the error state."
</p></blockquote>

<p>
where correct and important, they are invalid now for ifstream and
ofstream (because clear *does* indeed modify the error state) and
should be removed (Interestingly fstream itself never had these,
although
they where needed for that time).
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[ifstream.members]"/>, remove footnote:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<del><sup>334)</sup> A successful open does not change the error state.</del>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
In <sref ref="[ofstream.members]"/>, remove footnote:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<del><sup>335)</sup> A successful open does not change the error state.</del>
</p></blockquote>

</resolution>
