<p>
One of goals of C++0x is to make language easier to teach and for
'incidental' programmers. The fine-grained headers of the C++ library
are valuable in large scale systems for managing dependencies and
optimising build times, but overcomplicated for simple development and
tutorials. Add additional headers to support the whole library through a
single include statement.

This issue
adds a header <tt>&lt;std&gt;</tt>.
</p>
<p>
There is a paper to be looked at,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2905.pdf">N2905</a>
Aggregation headers, that adds
a header <tt>&lt;std-all&gt;</tt> that is the same thing except it excludes
deprecated headers.
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2905.pdf">N2905</a>
also proposes a second aggregation header.
</p>
<p>
Seems like this issue should be held in abeyance until the LWG has had
a chance to look at <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2905.pdf">N2905</a>.

<resolution>
<p>
Insert a new paragraph in <sref ref="[headers]"/> between p4 and p5
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An additional header <tt>&lt;std&gt;</tt> shall have the effect of
supplying the entire standard library.  [<i>Note:</i> for example, it
might be implemented as a file with an <tt>#include</tt> statement for each of the
headers listed in tables 13 and 14. <i>-- end note</i>]
