<title><tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> should declare <tt>abs(double)</tt></title>

&hellip; and <tt>abs(float)</tt> and <tt>abs(long double)</tt>. And <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> should declare 
<tt>abs(int)</tt>, <tt>abs(long)</tt>, and <tt>abs(long long)</tt>.
<p/>
As things currently stand, this program is illegal:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() {
  double d = -1.23;
  double dd = std::abs(d);
  return 0;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The call is ambiguous because of the various integer overloads, that's because <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> provides 
<tt>abs(int)</tt> but not <tt>abs(double)</tt>.
<p/>
This lead one commenter on Stackoverflow to state that <tt>abs</tt> is dangerous, and to recommend using <tt>fabs</tt> instead.
<p/>
In general, it makes sense to declare overloaded functions that take user-defined types in the same header as the 
definition of the user-defined types; it isn't necessary to declare all of the overloads in the same place. But 
here we're not dealing with any user-defined types; we're dealing with builtin types, which are always defined; 
all of the overloads should be defined in the same place, to avoid mysterious problems like the one in the code above.
<p/>
The standard library has six overloads for <tt>abs</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
int abs(int);  // &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long abs(long); // &lt;cstdlib&gt;
long long abs(long long); // &lt;cstdlib&gt;

float abs(float); // &lt;cmath&gt;
double abs(double); // &lt;cmath&gt;
long double abs(long double); // &lt;cmath&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
These should all be declared in both headers.
<p/>
I have no opinion on <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>.
