<title>Stringstreams read/write pointers initial position unclear</title>

<p>&quot;We are not sure how to interpret the CD2 (see <sref ref="[iostream.forward]"/>, <sref ref="[ostringstream.cons]"/>, <sref ref="[stringbuf.cons]"/>)
with respect to the question as to what the correct initial positions
of the write and&nbsp; read pointers of a stringstream should
be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the same to output two strings or to initialize the stringstream with the
first and to output the second?&quot;</p>

<note>PJ Plauger, Bjarne Stroustrup, Randy Smithey, Sean Corfield, and
Jerry Schwarz have all offered opinions; see reflector messages
lib-6518, 6519, 6520, 6521, 6523, 6524.</note>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG believes the Standard is correct as written. The behavior
of stringstreams is consistent with fstreams, and there is a
constructor which can be used to obtain the desired effect. This
behavior is known to be different from strstreams.</p>
