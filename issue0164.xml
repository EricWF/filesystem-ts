<title>do_put() has apparently unused fill argument</title>

<discussion>
<p>In <sref ref="[locale.time.put.virtuals]"/> the do_put() function is specified
as taking a fill character as an argument, but the description of the
function does not say whether the character is used at all and, if so,
in which way. The same holds for any format control parameters that
are accessible through the ios_base&amp; argument, such as the
adjustment or the field width. Is strftime() supposed to use the fill
character in any way? In any case, the specification of
time_put.do_put() looks inconsistent to me.<br/> <br/> Is the
signature of do_put() wrong, or is the effects clause incomplete?</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add the following note after <sref ref="[locale.time.put.virtuals]"/>
paragraph 2:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  [Note: the <tt>fill</tt> argument may be used in the implementation-defined  formats, or by derivations.  A space character is a reasonable default
  for this argument. --end Note]</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG felt that while the normative text was correct,
users need some guidance on what to pass for the <tt>fill</tt>
argument since the standard doesn't say how it's used.</p>
</rationale>
