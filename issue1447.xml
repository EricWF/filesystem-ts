Resolve issue LWG 1328 one way or the other, but
preferably in the direction outlined in the proposed
resolution, which, however, is not complete as-is: in any
case, the sentry must not set ok_ = false if is.good() ==
false, otherwise istream::seekg, being an unformatted
input function, does not take any action because the
sentry object returns false when converted to type bool.
Thus, it remains impossible to seek away from end of file.
