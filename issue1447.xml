<p>
Resolve issue LWG 1328 one way or the other, but
preferably in the direction outlined in the proposed
resolution, which, however, is not complete as-is: in any
case, the sentry must not set <tt>ok_ = false</tt> if <tt>is.good() == false</tt>, 
otherwise <tt>istream::seekg</tt>, being an unformatted
input function, does not take any action because the
sentry object returns false when converted to type <tt>bool</tt>.
Thus, it remains impossible to seek away from end of file.
