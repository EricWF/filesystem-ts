<p>
I'm trying to reconcile the note in tr.util.smartptr.shared.obs, p6
that talks about the operator*() member function of shared_ptr:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Notes: When T is void, attempting to instantiate this member function
  renders the program ill-formed. [Note: Instantiating shared_ptr&lt;void&gt;
  does not necessarily result in instantiating this member function.
  --end note]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
with the requirement in temp.inst, p1:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
  The implicit instantiation of a class template specialization causes
  the implicit instantiation of the declarations, but not of the
  definitions...
</p></blockquote>

<p>
I assume that what the note is really trying to say is that
"instantiating shared_ptr&lt;void&gt; *must not* result in instantiating
this member function." That is, that this function must not be
declared a member of shared_ptr&lt;void&gt;. Is my interpretation
correct?
</p>
