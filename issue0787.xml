<title>complexity of <tt>binary_search</tt></title>

<p>
In <sref ref="[binary.search]"/> p. 3 the complexity of <tt>binary_search</tt> is described as
</p>

<blockquote><p>
At most <tt>log(last - first) + 2</tt> comparisons.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
This should be precised and brought in line with the nomenclature used for
<tt>lower_bound</tt>, <tt>upper_bound</tt>, and <tt>equal_range</tt>.
</p>

<p>
All existing libraries I'm aware of, delegate to
<tt>lower_bound</tt> (+ one further comparison). Since
issue <iref ref="384"/> has now WP status, the resolution of #787 should
be brought in-line with <iref ref="384"/> by changing the <tt>+ 2</tt>
to <tt>+ O(1)</tt>.

<blockquote><p>
Alisdair prefers to apply an upper bound instead of O(1), but that would
require fixing for <tt>lower_bound</tt>, <tt>upper_bound</tt> etc. as well. If he really
cares about it, he'll send an issue to Howard.
