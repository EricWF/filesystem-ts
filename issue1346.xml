<p>
Issues with efficiency and unsatisfactory semantics mean
many library functions document they do not throw
exceptions with a Throws: Nothing clause, but do not
advertise it with an exception specification. The semantic
issues are largely resolved with the new 'noexcept'
specifications, and the noexcept operator means we will
want to detect these guarantees programatically in order
to construct programs taking advantage of the guarantee.

Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Add a <tt>noexcept</tt> exception specification on each
libary API that offers an unconditional <i>Throws</i>:
Nothing guarantee. Where the guarantee is
conditional, add the appropriate
<tt>noexcept(<i>constant-expression</i>)</tt> if an appropriate
constant expression exists.
