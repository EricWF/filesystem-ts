<p>
Despite Library Issue 520's ("<tt>result_of</tt> and pointers to
data members") resolution of CD1, the FCD's <tt>result_of</tt>
supports neither pointers to member functions nor
pointers to data members. It should.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Ensure <tt>result_of</tt> supports pointers to member
functions and pointers to data members.
