<title>[PDTS] Parent of root directory unspecified</title>

<discussion>
<p>8.1 [path.generic] says:
"The filename dot-dot is treated as a reference to the parent directory." So it must be
specified what "/.." and "/../.." refer to.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add a statement what the parent directory of the root directory is.</p>

  <h4>Proposed wording:</h4>

  <p>
    <i>[2014-02-07: Beman Dawes]</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Change 8.1:</i> The filename <i>dot</i> is treated as a reference to the current directory.
    The filename <i>dot-dot</i> is treated as a reference to the parent directory.
    <ins>[<i>Note:</i> The <i>root-directory</i> has no parent directory.<i>--end note</i>]</ins>
    Specific filenames may have special meanings for a particular operating system.
  </p>

</resolution>
