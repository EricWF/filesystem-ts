<p>
The general approach on moving is that a library object
after moving out is in a "valid but unspecified state". But
this is stated at the single object specifications, which is
error prone (especially if the move operations are implicit)
and unnecessary duplication.

Consider putting a general statement to the same
effect into clause 17.

<note>2010-11-05 Beman provides exact wording.
The wording was inspired by Dave Abrahams'
message c++std-lib-28958, and refined with help from Alisdair, Daniel, and Howard.
