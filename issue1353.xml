<discussion>
The general approach on moving is that a library object
after moving out is in a "valid but unspecified state". But
this is stated at the single object specifications, which is
error prone (especially if the move operations are implicit)
and unnecessary duplication.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Consider putting a general statement to the same
effect into clause 17.
