<p><b>Addresses UK 238</b></p>

<p>
Leaving it unspecified whether or not <tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> are the
same type is dangerous, as user code may or may not violate the One
Definition Rule by providing overloads for 
both types. It is probably too late to specify a single behaviour, but
implementors should document what to expect. Observing that problems can be
avoided by users restricting themselves to using <tt>const_iterator</tt>, add a note to that effect. 
</p>
<p>
Suggest Change 'unspecified' to 'implementation defined'.

Agree with issue. Agree with adding the note but not with changing the

<p>
In <sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/> p6, add:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
-6- <tt>iterator</tt> of an associative container meets the requirements
of the <tt>BidirectionalIterator</tt> concept. For associative
containers where the value type is the same as the key type, both
<tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> are constant iterators. It
is unspecified whether or not <tt>iterator</tt> and
<tt>const_iterator</tt> are the same type.
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> <tt>iterator</tt> and <tt>const_iterator</tt> have identical semantics in
this case, and <tt>iterator</tt> is convertible to <tt>const_iterator</tt>. Users can avoid
violating the One Definition Rule by always using <tt>const_iterator</tt>
in their function parameter lists <i>-- end note</i>]</ins>
