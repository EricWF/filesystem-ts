<p>27.5.2.4.2, p4, and 27.8.1.6, p2, 27.8.1.7, p3, 27.8.1.9, p2,
27.8.1.10, p3 refer to in and/or out w/o ios_base:: qualification.
That's incorrect since the names are members of a dependent base
class (14.6.2 [temp.dep]) and thus not visible.</p>

<resolution>
<p>Qualify the names with the name of the class of which they are
members, i.e., ios_base.</p>
