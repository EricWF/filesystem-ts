<p>
<tt>vector&lt;bool></tt> iterators are not random access iterators
because their reference type is a special class, and not
<tt>bool &amp;</tt>. All standard libary operations taking iterators
should treat this iterator as if it was a random access iterator, rather
than a simple input iterator.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed in ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support proxy iterators
(restoring functionality that was lost when the Concept facility was
removed) or add an extra paragraph to the <tt>vector&lt;bool</tt>
specification requiring the library to treat <tt>vector&lt;bool></tt>
iterators as-if they were random access iterators, despite having the wrong
reference type.
