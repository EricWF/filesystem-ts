<p>
<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> iterators are not random access iterators
because their reference type is a special class, and not
<tt>bool &amp;</tt>. All standard libary operations taking iterators
should treat this iterator as if it was a random access iterator, rather
than a simple input iterator.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed in ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support proxy iterators
(restoring functionality that was lost when the Concept facility was
removed) or add an extra paragraph to the <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
specification requiring the library to treat <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
iterators as-if they were random access iterators, despite having the wrong
reference type.
</p>

<note>
Rapperswil Review
</note>
<p>
The consensus at Rapperswil is that it is too late for full support for
proxy iterators, but requiring the library to respect <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>
iterators as-if they were random access would be preferable to flagging
this container as deliberately incompatible with standard library algorithms.
</p>
<p>
Alisdair to write the note, which may become normative <i>Remark</i> depending
on the preferences of the project editor.
</p>

<note>
Post-Rapperswil Alisdair provides wording
</note>
<p>
Initial wording is supplied, deliberately using <i>Note</i> in preference to
<i>Remark</i> although the author notes his preference for <i>Remark</i>.  The
issue of whether <tt>iterator_traits&lt;vector&lt;bool&gt;&gt;::iterator_category</tt>
is permitted to report <tt>random_access_iterator_tag</tt> or must report 
<tt>input_iterator_tag</tt> is not addressed.
</p>

<note>
Old Proposed Resolution:
</note>
<blockquote>
<p>
Insert a new paragraph into <sref ref="[vector.bool]"/> between p4 and p5:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note</i> All functions in the library that take a pair of iterators to
denote a range shall treat <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> iterators as-if they were
random access iterators, even though the <tt>reference</tt> type is not a
true reference.<i>-- end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

</note>
<blockquote><p>
Closed as NAD Future, because the current iterator categories cannot correctly describe
<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::iterator</tt>. But saying that they are Random Access Iterators
is also incorrect, because it is not too hard to create a corresponding test that fails.
We should deal with the more general proxy iterator problem in the future, and see no
benefit to take a partial workaround specific to <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> now.
