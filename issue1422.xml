<discussion>
vector&lt;bool&gt; iterators are not random access iterators
because their reference type is a special class, and not
'bool &amp;'. All standard libary operations taking iterators
should treat this iterator as if it was a random access
iterator, rather than a simple input iterator.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Either revise the iterator requirements to support
proxy iterators (restoring functionality that was lost
when the Concept facility was removed) or add an
extra paragraph to the vector&lt;bool&gt; specification
requiring the library to treat vector&lt;bool&gt; iterators
as-if they were random access iterators, despite
having the wrong reference type.
</resolution>
