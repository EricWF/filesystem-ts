<p>
<iref ref="527"/> Added a throws clause to <tt>bind</tt> constructors.  I believe the same throws clause
should be added to <tt>tuple</tt> except it ought to take into account move constructors as well.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Add to <sref ref="[tuple.cnstr]"/>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For each <tt>tuple</tt> constructor and assignment operator, an exception is thrown only if the construction
or assignment of one of the types in <tt>Types</tt> throws an exception.
</p>
</blockquote>
