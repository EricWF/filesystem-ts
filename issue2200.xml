<title>Data race avoidance for all containers, not only for sequences</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[container.requirements.dataraces]"/>/2 says "[&hellip;] implementations are
required to avoid data races when the contents of the contained object in different 
elements in the same sequence, excepting <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>, are modified 
concurrently."
</p>
<p>
This should say "same container" instead of "same sequence", to avoid
the interpretation that it only applies to sequence containers.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3376.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[container.requirements.dataraces]"/>/2 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote><p>
-2- Notwithstanding (<sref ref="[res.on.data.races]"/>), implementations are required to avoid data races when 
the contents of the contained object in different elements in the same <del>sequence</del><ins>container</ins>, 
excepting <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>, are modified concurrently.
<p/>
-3- [<i>Note</i>: For a <tt>vector&lt;int&gt; x</tt> with a size greater than one, <tt>x[1] = 5</tt> and 
<tt>*x.begin() = 10</tt> can be executed concurrently without a data race, but <tt>x[0] = 5</tt> and 
<tt>*x.begin() = 10</tt> executed concurrently may result in a data race. As an exception to the general 
rule, for a <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt; y, y[0] = true</tt> may race with <tt>y[1] = true</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i> ]
