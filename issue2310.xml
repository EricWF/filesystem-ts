<title>Public <em>exposition only</em> member in <tt>std::array</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[array.overview]"/></section>

<p>
<sref ref="[array.overview]"/> shows <tt>std::array</tt> with an "exposition only" data member, <tt>elems</tt>.
<p/>
The wording in <sref ref="[objects.within.classes]"/> that defines how
"exposition only" is used says it applies to private members, but
<tt>std::array::elems</tt> (or its equivalent) must be public in order for
<tt>std::array</tt> to be an aggregate.
<p/>
If the intention is that <tt>std::array::elems</tt> places requirements on the
implementation to provide "equivalent external behavior" to a public
array member, then <sref ref="[objects.within.classes]"/> needs to cover public
members too, or some other form should be used in <sref ref="[array.overview]"/>.
