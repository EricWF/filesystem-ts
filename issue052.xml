<p>First, <sref ref="[basic.ios.cons]"/>, table 89. This is pretty obvious:
it should be titled &quot;basic_ios&lt;&gt;() effects&quot;, not
&quot;ios_base() effects&quot;. </p>

<p>[The second item is a duplicate; see issue <iref ref="6"/> for
resolution.]</p>

<p>Second, <sref ref="[fpos.operations]"/> table 88 . There are a couple
different things wrong with it, some of which I've already discussed
with Jerry, but the most obvious mechanical sort of error is that it
uses expressions like P(i) and p(i), without ever defining what sort
of thing &quot;i&quot; is.
</p>

<p>(The other problem is that it requires support for streampos
arithmetic. This is impossible on some systems, i.e. ones where file
position is a complicated structure rather than just a number. Jerry
tells me that the intention was to require syntactic support for
streampos arithmetic, but that it wasn't actually supposed to do
anything meaningful except on platforms, like Unix, where genuine
arithmetic is possible.) </p>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[basic.ios.cons]"/> table 89 title from
&quot;ios_base() effects&quot; to &quot;basic_ios&lt;&gt;()
effects&quot;. </p>
</resolution>
