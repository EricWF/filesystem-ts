<p><b>Addresses GB-65</b></p>
<p>
Nothrowing swap operations are key to many C++ idioms,
notably the common copy/swap idiom to provide the
strong exception safety guarantee.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
Where possible, all library types should provide a
swap operation with an exception specification
guaranteeing no exception shall propagate.
Where noexcept(true) cannot be guaranteed to
not terminate the program, and the swap in
questions is a template, an exception specification
with the appropriate conditional expression could
be specified.
</resolution>
