<p>
Nothrowing <tt>swap</tt> operations are key to many C++ idioms,
notably the common copy/swap idiom to provide the
strong exception safety guarantee.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Where possible, all library types should provide a
<tt>swap</tt> operation with an exception specification
guaranteeing no exception shall propagate.
Where <tt>noexcept(true)</tt> cannot be guaranteed to
not terminate the program, and the <tt>swap</tt> in
questions is a template, an exception specification
with the appropriate conditional expression could
be specified.
