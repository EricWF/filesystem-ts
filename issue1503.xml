The term "associated asynchronous state" is long, ugly
and misleading terminology. When introduced we agreed
upon that we should come up with a better name. Here it
is: "liaison state". Since the state is hidden and provides
synchronization of a future with its corresponding promise,
we believe "liaison state" is a much better and shorter
name (liaison ~ (typically hidden) relationship)

<resolution>
The project editor may supply a more appopriate term, or use "liaison state",
at his own discretion.
