The term "associated asynchronous state" is long, ugly
and misleading terminology. When introduced we agreed
upon that we should come up with a better name. Here it
is: "liaison state". Since the state is hidden and provides
synchronization of a future with its corresponding promise,
we believe "liaison state" is a much better and shorter
name (liaison ~ (typically hidden) relationship)
</discussion>

<resolution>
Change all occurrences of "associated
asynchronous state" to "liaison state".
