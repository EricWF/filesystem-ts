<p>
The term "associated asynchronous state" is long, ugly and misleading terminology. When 
introduced we agreed upon that we should come up with a better name. Here it is: 
"liaison state". Since the state is hidden and provides synchronization of a 
<tt>future</tt> with its corresponding <tt>promise</tt>, we believe "liaison state" is 
a much better and shorter name (liaison ~ (typically hidden) relationship)

Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

<blockquote><p>
Change all occurrences of "associated
asynchronous state" to "liaison state".

<resolution>
<p>The project editor may supply a more appopriate term, or use "liaison state",
at his own discretion.</p>
