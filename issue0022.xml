<discussion>
<p>The behaviour of increment is underspecified: What happens if the implementation
detects an endless loop (e.g. caused by links)? What happens with automounting and
possible race conditions?</p>
<p>More information on this can be found <a href="http://man7.org/linux/manpages/man3/fts.3.html">here</a>.
<p>Suggested action:</p>
<p>Specify the required behaviour in these cases.</p>
</p>

  <note>2014-02-13 Beman Dawes</note>
  <p/>Suggest NAD. <tt>increment</tt> takes an <tt>error_code& ec</tt> argument and its error reporting
  is no different from any other function in the library with such an argument. 7 Error reporting [fs.err.report]
  and other front matter already answer the questions posed in great detail.
  
  <p/>It might be a bit clearer to globally change "Throws: as specified in Error reporting." to
  "Remarks: Errors are reported as specified in 7 [fs.err.report]" so that it is clearer that both
  throwing and non-throwing signatures are covered.
