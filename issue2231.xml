From the question at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/14094408/981959">stackoverflow</a>.
</p>

<p>
Were we aware that the resolution to LWG <iref ref="704"/> means there is no complexity guarantee for 
<tt>clear()</tt> on most sequence containers? Previously it was implied by defining it in terms of 
<tt>erase(begin(), end())</tt> but we no longer do that.
</p>

<p>
There are explicit complexity requirements for <tt>std::list::clear()</tt>, but not the other sequence containers.
</p>

<p>
The idea was that the notion of "destroys all elements in <tt>a</tt>" would imply a linear complexity, but the wording 
needs to be clearer, because this doesn't say that this step is the actual complexity bound.
