<title>Ios_base needs clear(), exceptions()</title>

<discussion>
<p>The description of ios_base::iword() and pword() in <sref ref="[ios.members.static]"/>, say that if they fail, they &quot;set badbit,
which may throw an exception&quot;. However, ios_base offers no
interface to set or to test badbit; those interfaces are defined in
basic_ios&lt;&gt;. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change the description in <sref ref="[ios.base.storage]"/> in
paragraph 2, and also in paragraph 4, as follows. Replace</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the function fails it sets badbit, which may throw an exception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the function fails, and <tt>*this</tt> is a base sub-object of
  a <tt>basic_ios&lt;&gt;</tt> object or sub-object, the effect is
  equivalent to calling <tt>basic_ios&lt;&gt;::setstate(badbit)</tt>
  on the derived object (which may throw <tt>failure</tt>).</p>
</blockquote>

<note>Kona: LWG reviewed wording; setstate(failbit) changed to
setstate(badbit).</note>

</resolution>
