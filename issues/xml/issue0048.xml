<p>
<tt>path::template&lt;class charT&gt;string()</tt> should promise to convert by the same
rules as <tt>u16string</tt> for <tt>string&lt;char16_t&gt;</tt>, etc. and one-for-one otherwise.
<p/>
What if <tt>charT</tt> is <tt>signed char</tt> (or even <tt>float</tt>)? I don't see where that choice
is disallowed, so we should either disallow it or make it be something that is quasi-sensible.

<p>
There are two relevant places in the wording that seem to clarify what is required here:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Most importantly, 5 [fs.req] says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Throughout this Technical Specification, <tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, and <tt>char32_t</tt> 
are collectively called <em>encoded character types</em>.
<p/>
Template parameters named <tt>charT</tt> shall be one of the encoded character types.
<p/>
[&hellip;]
[<i>Note</i>: Use of an encoded character type implies an associated encoding. Since <tt>signed char</tt> and <tt>unsigned char</tt> 
have no implied encoding, they are not included as permitted types. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>
For both the mentioned <tt>string</tt> function template and the specific non-template functions (such as <tt>u16string()</tt>)
the same <tt>Remarks</tt> element exists, that refers to character conversion:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Conversion, if any, is performed as specified by 8.2 [path.cvt].
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first quote excludes arbitrary types such as <tt>signed char</tt> or <tt>float</tt> as feasible template arguments. 
The second quote makes clear that both the function template and the non-template functions do normatively refer to the same 
wording in 8.2 [path.cvt].
<p/>
Based on this interpretation of the issue discussion I recommend resolving it as NAD.
<p/>
In addition to that recommendation I recommend to rename the current usage of the symbol <tt>charT</tt> in this technical
specification, because 5 [fs.req] assigns a very special meaning to the constraints on <tt>charT</tt> types that does not
exist to this extend in the rest of the standard library. A similar approach is used in Clause 22, where a special symbol <tt>C</tt>
is used for constrained character types (C++11 &sect;22.3.1.1.1 [locale.category]):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A template formal parameter with name <tt>C</tt> represents the set of types containing <tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, 
and any other implementation-defined character types that satisfy the requirements for a character on which any of the 
<tt>iostream</tt> components can be instantiated.
</p></blockquote>

<note>2014-02-28 Beman provides proposed resolution wording</note>

</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In the entire Working Paper, change each instance of "<code>charT</code>" to "<code>C</code>".</p>
<p>For example, in 5 [fs.req]:</p>
<blockquote>Template parameters named <del><code>charT</code></del> <ins><code>C</code></ins> shall be one of the 
encoded character types.</blockquote>
</resolution>
