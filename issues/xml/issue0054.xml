<discussion>
  <p>We have two primary concerns with the interface as specified: </p>
  <p>
    (a) its interface repeats the mistake of V7 Unix in 1979 by exposing access
    checking (and similarly file creation) independently from opening and mutating
    the file, and
  </p>
  <p>
    (b) it provides no realistic means of testing a software library which uses
    the standard interface for accessing the filesystem under fault scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the extent of (a), TOCTTOU [1] security vulnerabilities are
    guaranteed, if not during access checking[2], during other common operations
    such as temporary file creation[3].
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to (b) it is impossible to portably test libraries using the proposed
    interface against critical correctness and security edge cases.
