<p>8.1 [path.generic] says:
"The filename dot-dot is treated as a reference to the parent directory." So it must be
specified what "/.." and "/../.." refer to.</p>

<p>Add a statement what the parent directory of the root directory is.</p>

  <note>2014-02-07, Beman Dawes suggests wording</note>
  
  <note>
    2014-02-11 Issaquah: Implementation defined. See wiki notes for rationale.
    Beman to provide wording for review next meeting.
