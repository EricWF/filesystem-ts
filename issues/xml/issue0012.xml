<title>[PDTS] <tt>uintmax_t</tt> too small for large file sizes</title>

<discussion>
<p><tt>uintmax_t</tt> is specified to hold at least 64 bit. This is not enough for sizes
beyond 4 [sic] exabytes.</p>

<p>Specify whether an implementation must provide a <tt>uintmax_t</tt> that can hold the maximum
possible space and file size values.</p>

  <p>
    <i>[2014-02-06: Jeffery Yasskin points out 64-bits unsigned actually has a maximum value of "16 exabytes, not 4"]</i>

    <i>[2014-02-07: Beman Dawes suggests: This should be NAD. Such ultra-large files are the province
    of enterprise-wide filesystems such as requested by IBM and others for a follow-on SG3 TS. That would be
    the best vehicle to address this concern IMO.]</i>
