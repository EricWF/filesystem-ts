<p>Path depth is implementation dependent.</p>

<p>Add a paragraph: "The maximum length of the sequence (i.e. the maximum depth) is
 implementation dependent.</p>

 <note>2014-02-07, Beman Dawes comments</note>

   <p>
    "implementaton defined" and "operating system dependent"
    are well defined terms in this TS, but "implementation dependent" is not well defined.
    The path depth is operating system dependent, so that's the form used in the proposed wording.
  </p>
