<discussion>
<p>Filename lengths are also implementation dependent. This is not the same as
<tt>FILENAME_MAX</tt> that specifies the maximum length of pathnames.</p>

<p>Add a bullet: "Length of filenames."</p>

<resolution>
<p>Change 4.7 [fs.def.filename]:</p>
  <p>The name of a file. Filenames dot&nbsp; and dot-dot&nbsp; have special meaning. The following characteristics of 
  filenames are operating system dependent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>The permitted characters. [<i>Example</i>: Some operating systems prohibit the ASCII control characters (0x00-0x1F) 
    in filenames. &mdash; <i>end example</i>].</p>
  </li>
  <li><ins>The maximum permitted length.</ins></li>
  <li>
  <p>Filenames that are not permitted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Filenames that have special meaning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Case awareness and sensitivity during path resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Special rules that may apply to file types other than regular 
  files, such as directories.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
