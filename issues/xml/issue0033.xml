<title>[PDTS] <tt>unique_path()</tt> is a security vulnerability</title>

<discussion>
<p><tt>unique_path()</tt> is a security vulnerability. As the Linux manual page for the similar
function <tt>tmpnam()</tt> writes in the "BUGS" section: "Never use this function. Use <tt>mkstemp</tt>(3)
or <tt>tmpfile</tt>(3) instead." <tt>mkstemp()</tt> and <tt>tmpfile()</tt> avoid the inherent race condition of
<tt>unique_path()</tt> by returning an open file descriptor or <tt>FILE*</tt>.</p>

<p/><i>[Beman Dawes comments: 10 Feb 2014:]</i>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are two issues here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Confusion over what unique_path does and how it is used. The function is
        misleadingly named. These issue have arisen in the past, but apparently not
        been fully corrected. The suggested fix is to (1) rename the function and (2)
        provide an example of how to use the function safely with fstreams or even C I/O.
        See below for proposed wording.
      </li>
      <li>
        Very real security concerns. See <a href="#54">issue 54</a>. The security
        concerns are probably best dealt with in the next File System TS, since a
        full-blown proposal is needed and will likely take several years to develop.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <note>2014-02-12 The following Proposed resolution from CH-19 was moved here
  to avoid confusion with the final Proposed resolution wording from the WG/SG3.</note>
  <p>
    Remove this function. Consider providing a function <tt>create_unique_directory()</tt>.
    If it fits the scope of the proposed TS, consider providing functions
    <tt>create_unique_file()</tt> that returns <tt>ifstream</tt>, <tt>ofstream</tt> and <tt>iofstream</tt>.

      The <code>
        <del>unique_path</del>
        <ins>generate_random_filename</ins>
      </code> function generates a name suitable for temporary files, including directories. The name is based
      on a model that uses the percent sign character to specify replacement by a
      random hexadecimal digit.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Note:</i> The more bits of randomness in the
      generated name, the less likelihood of prior existence or being guessed.
      Each replacement hexadecimal digit in the model adds four bits of randomness.
      The default model thus provides 64 bits of randomness. <i>--end note</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Returns:</i> A path identical to <code>model</code>, except that each
      occurrence of the percent sign character is replaced by a random hexadecimal
      digit character in the range 0-9, a-f. The signature with argument <code>ec</code>
      returns <code>path()</code> if an error occurs.

      <i>Throws:</i> As specified in <a href="#Error-reporting">Error reporting</a>.

      <i>Remarks:</i> Implementations are encouraged to obtain the required
      randomness via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator</a>, such as one
      provided by the operating system. [<i>Note</i>: Such generators may block

      Typical output would be <code>&quot;test-0db7f2bf57a.txt&quot;</code>. Because 11

<resolution>

  <p/>Remove the two <code>unique_path</code> function signatures from 6 [fs.filesystem.synopsis].

  <p/>Remove 15.38 [fs.op.unique_path] in its entirety.
  
  <note>This removes all references the function from the working draft.</note>
 
</resolution>
