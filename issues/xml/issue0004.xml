<discussion>
<p>The concept of a parent directory for dot or dotdot exists, but the definition doesn't apply.</p>

<p>Suggested action:</p>

<p>Remove the paragraph. This concept does not apply to dot and dot-dot. Add a definition for dot and dot-dot.</p>

<p>Suggest it is editorial and should be passed to the project editor.</p>

  <note>
    2014-02-11 Issaquah: Beman to provide wording for review next meeting. Also see related issue 5.

  <blockquote>
    <p>I've now reviewed this issue carefully and believe it is NAD. "parent" is used in four places in the WP,
    and so deserves a definition. The current definition is copied word-for-word and in its entirety from the
    POSIX definition. I believe strongly that the File System TS needs to stay in alignment with POSIX on
    this matter,
    and that the best way to do that is simply to use the POSIX wording.</p>
