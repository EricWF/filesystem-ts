  In a recent discussion on the Boost developers mailing list, the semantics of <code>operator /</code>
  and other append operations were questioned:
</p>

  <p/>In brief, currently <code>p1 / p2</code> is required to concatenate the
  lexical representation of <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, inserting a
  preferred separator as needed.

  <p/>This means that, for example, <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;d:\y&quot;</code> gives <code>
    &quot;c:\x\d:\y&quot;</code>, and that <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;\\server\share&quot;</code>
    gives <code>&quot;c:\x\\server\share&quot;</code>. This is rarely, if ever, useful.

  <p/>An alternative interpretation of <code>p1 / p2</code> could be that it yields a
  path that is the approximation of what <code>p2</code> would mean if interpreted
  in an environment in which <code>p1</code> is the starting directory. 
  Under this interpretation, <code>&quot;c:\x&quot; / &quot;d:\y&quot;</code> gives <code>&quot;d:\y&quot;</code>,
  which is more likely to match what was intended.

  <p/>I am not saying that this second interpretation is the right one, but I do say
  that we have reasons to suspect that the first one (lexical concatenation using
  a separator) may not be entirely correct.
  This leads me to think that the behavior of <code>p1 / p2</code>, when <code>p2</code>
  has a root, needs to be left implementation-defined, so that implementations are
  not required to do the wrong thing, as above.

  <p/>This change will not affect the ordinary use case in which <code>p2</code> is a
  relative, root-less, path.
