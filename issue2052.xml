(this is basically reopening the first part of issue <iref ref="2006"/>, as discussed in the thread 
starting at c++std-lib-30698 )
<p/>
Section <sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/>
<p/>
In Table 102, several uses of <tt>T</tt> (which means <tt>mapped_type</tt> here) should
be <tt>value_type</tt> instead. This is almost editorial. For instance:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
a_uniq.emplace(args)
</pre><p>
<i>Requires</i>: <tt>T</tt> shall be <tt>EmplaceConstructible</tt> into <tt>X</tt> from args.
<p/>
<i>Effects</i>: Inserts a <tt>T</tt> object <tt>t</tt> constructed with
<tt>std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...</tt> if and only if there is no element in the
container with key equivalent to the key of <tt>t</tt>. The <tt>bool</tt> component of
the returned pair is true if and only if the insertion takes place, and the iterator component 
of the pair points to the element with key equivalent to the key of <tt>t</tt>.

Not even an exhaustive list of problem locations. No reason to doubt issue.
