<p>
<tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> provides a mechanism for initializing random number
engines which ideally would yield "distant" states when given "close"
seeds.  The algorithm for <tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> given in the current
Working Draft for C++,
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2284.pdf">N2284</a>
(2007-05-08), has 3 weaknesses
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Collisions in state.  Because of the way the state is initialized,
    seeds of different lengths may result in the same state.  The
    current version of seed_seq has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>  For a given <tt>s &lt;= n</tt>, each of the 2^(32s) seed vectors results in a
      distinct state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The proposed algorithm (below) has the considerably stronger
    properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>   All of the <tt>(2^(32n)-1)/(2^32-1)</tt> seed vectors of lengths <tt>s &lt; n</tt>
      result in distinct states.
</li>
<li>  All of the <tt>2^(32n)</tt> seed vectors of length <tt>s == n</tt> result in
      distinct states.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> Poor mixing of <tt>v'</tt>s entropy into the state.  Consider <tt>v.size() == n</tt>
    and hold <tt>v[n/2]</tt> thru <tt>v[n-1]</tt> fixed while varying <tt>v[0]</tt> thru <tt>v[n/2-1]</tt>,
    a total of <tt>2^(16n)</tt> possibilities.  Because of the simple recursion
    used in <tt>seed_seq</tt>, <tt>begin[n/2]</tt> thru <tt>begin[n-1]</tt> can take on only 2^64
    possible states.</p>

<p> The proposed algorithm uses a more complex recursion which results
    in much better mixing.</p>
</li>
<li> <tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> is undefined for <tt>v.size() == 0</tt>.  The proposed
    algorithm remedies this.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The current algorithm for <tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> is adapted by me from the
initialization procedure for the Mersenne Twister by Makoto Matsumoto
and Takuji Nishimura.  The weakness (2) given above was communicated to
me by Matsumoto last year.
</p>
<p>
The proposed replacement for <tt>seed_seq::randomize</tt> is due to Mutsuo Saito,
a student of Matsumoto, and is given in the implementation of the
SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister random number generator SFMT.

<p>
One change has been made here, namely to treat the case of small <tt>n</tt>
(setting <tt>t = (n-1)/2</tt> for <tt>n &lt; 7</tt>).
</p>
<p>
Since <tt>seed_seq</tt> was introduced relatively recently there is little cost
in making this incompatible improvement to it.
