<discussion>
<p>
In Berlin, as a working group, we voted in favor of N1932 which makes issue 507 moot:
variate_generator has been eliminated.  Then in full committee we voted to give
this issue WP status (mistakenly).
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Strike the proposed resolution of issue 507.
</p>
<note>
post-Portland:  Walter and Howard recommend NAD.  The proposed resolution of 507 no longer
exists in the current WD.
