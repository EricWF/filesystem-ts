<title>Placement forms example in error twice</title>

<discussion>
<p>Section 18.5.1.3 contains the following example: </p>

<pre>[Example: This can be useful for constructing an object at a known address:
        char place[sizeof(Something)];
        Something* p = new (place) Something();
 -end example]</pre>

<p>First code line: &quot;place&quot; need not have any special alignment, and the
following constructor could fail due to misaligned data.</p>

<p>Second code line: Aren't the parens on Something() incorrect?&nbsp; [Dublin: the LWG
believes the () are correct.]</p>

<p>Examples are not normative, but nevertheless should not show code that is invalid or
likely to fail.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Replace the first line of code in the example in 
<sref ref="[new.delete.placement]"/> with:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>void* place = operator new(sizeof(Something));</pre>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

</issue>
