<p>
The document uses the term "generic floating types," but defines it nowhere.

<p>
Change the first paragraph of "3 Decimal floating-point types" as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
This Technical Report introduces three decimal floating-point types, named
decimal32, decimal64, and decimal128. The set of values of type decimal32 is a
subset of the set of values of type decimal64; the set of values of the type
decimal64 is a subset of the set of values of the type decimal128. Support for
decimal128 is optional.  <ins>These types supplement the Standard C++ types
<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code>, which are
collectively described as the <i>basic floating types</i></ins>.
