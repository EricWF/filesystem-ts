<title>setbase manipulator description flawed</title>

<p><sref ref="[std.manip]"/> paragraph 5 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>smanip setbase(int base);</pre>
<p> Returns: An object s of unspecified type such that if out is an
(instance of) basic_ostream then the expression out&lt;&lt;s behaves
as if f(s) were called, in is an (instance of) basic_istream then the
expression in&gt;&gt;s behaves as if f(s) were called. Where f can be
defined as:</p>
<pre>ios_base&amp; f(ios_base&amp; str, int base)
{
  // set basefield
  str.setf(n == 8 ? ios_base::oct :
                n == 10 ? ios_base::dec :
                n == 16 ? ios_base::hex :
                  ios_base::fmtflags(0), ios_base::basefield);
  return str;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two problems here. First, f takes two parameters, so the
description needs to say that out&lt;&lt;s and in&gt;&gt;s behave as if f(s,base)
had been called. Second, f is has a parameter named base, but is written as if
the parameter was named n.</p>
<p>Actually, there's a third problem. The paragraph has grammatical errors.
There needs to be an &quot;and&quot; after the first comma, and the &quot;Where
f&quot; sentence fragment needs to be merged into its preceding sentence. You
may also want to format the function a little better. The formatting above is
more-or-less what the Standard contains.</p>
