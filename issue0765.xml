Issue <iref ref="278"/>
defines the meaning of the term "invalid iterator" as one that may be
singular.

       </p>
       <p>

Consider the following code:

       </p>
       <pre>
   std::deque&lt;int&gt; x, y;
   std::deque&lt;int&gt;::iterator i = x.end(), j = y.end();
   x.swap(y);
       </pre>
       <p>

Given that <code>swap()</code> is required not to invalidate iterators
and using the definition above, what should be the expected result of
comparing <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to <code>x.end()</code>
and <code>y.end()</code>, respectively, after the <code>swap()</code>?

       </p>
       <p>

I.e., is the expression below required to evaluate
to <code>true</code>?

       </p>
       <pre>
   i == y.end() &amp;&amp; j == x.end()
       </pre>
       <p>

(There are at least two implementations where the expression
returns <code>false</code>.)

       </p>
       <p>

More generally, is the definition introduced in issue <iref ref="278"/> meant to
make any guarantees about whether iterators actually point to the same
elements or be associated with the same containers after a
non-invalidating operation as they did before?

       </p>
       <p>

Here's a motivating example intended to demonstrate the importance of
the question:

       </p>
       <pre>
   Container x, y ({ 1, 2});   // pseudocode to initialize y with { 1, 2 }
   Container::iterator i = y.begin() + 1;
   Container::iterator j = y.end();
   std::swap(x, y);
   std::find(i, j, 3);
       </pre>
       <p>

<code>swap()</code> guarantees that <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>
continue to be valid. Unless the spec says that even though they are
valid they may no longer denote a valid range the code above must be
well-defined. Expert opinions on this differ as does the behavior of
popular implementations for some standard <code>Containers</code>.

<blockquote>
<p>
Pablo: add a note to the last bullet of paragraph 11 of 23.1.1 clarifying that 
the <tt>end()</tt> iterator doesn't refer to an element and that it can therefore be invalidated.
</p>
<p>
Proposed wording:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt> iterator does not refer to any element and can
therefore be invalidated. <i>-- end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Howard will add this proposed wording to the issue and then move it to Review.

Lawrence: suggestion: "Note: The <tt>end()</tt> iterator does not refer to any element"

Walter: "Note: The <tt>end()</tt> iterator can nevertheless be invalidated,
because it does not refer to any element."

Nick: "The <tt>end()</tt> iterator does not refer to any element. It is therefore
subject to being invalidated."

Consensus: go with Nick

With that update, Recommend Tentatively Ready.

Add to <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>, p11:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified (see 23.1.4.1, 23.1.5.1, 23.2.2.3, and
23.2.6.4) all container types defined in this Clause meet the following
additional requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>...</li>
<li>
no <tt>swap()</tt> function invalidates any references, pointers, or
iterators referring to the elements of the containers being swapped.

It is therefore subject to being invalidated. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</ins>
