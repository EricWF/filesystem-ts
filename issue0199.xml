<title>What does <tt>allocate(0)</tt> return?</title>

<p>
Suppose that <tt>A</tt> is a class that conforms to the
Allocator requirements of Table 32, and <tt>a</tt> is an
object of class <tt>A</tt>  What should be the return
value of <tt>a.allocate(0)</tt>?  Three reasonable
possibilities: forbid the argument <tt>0</tt>, return
a null pointer, or require that the return value be a
unique non-null pointer.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Add a note to the <tt>allocate</tt> row of Table 32:
&quot;[<i>Note:</i> If <tt>n == 0</tt>, the return value is unspecified. <i>--end note</i>]&quot;</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>A key to understanding this issue is that the ultimate use of
allocate() is to construct an iterator, and that iterator for zero
length sequences must be the container's past-the-end
representation.  Since this already implies special case code, it
would be over-specification to mandate the return value.
