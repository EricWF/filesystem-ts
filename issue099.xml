<title>Reverse_iterator comparisons completely wrong</title>

<discussion>
<p>The &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= comparison operator are wrong: they
return the opposite of what they should.</p>

<p>Note: same problem in CD2, these were not even defined in CD1.  SGI
STL code is correct; this problem is known since the Morristown
meeting but there it was too late</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>This is not a defect in the Standard. A careful reading shows the Standard is correct
as written. A review of several implementations show that they implement
exactly what the Standard says.</p>
