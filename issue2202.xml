<title>Missing allocator support by <tt>async</tt></title>

<p>
<tt>promise</tt>, <tt>packaged_task</tt>, and <tt>async</tt> are the only
places where a shared state is actually supposed to be allocated. Accordingly,
<tt>promise</tt> and <tt>packaged_task</tt> are "allocator-aware". But
function template <tt>async</tt> provides no way to provide an allocator.
<p/>
This is not just a theoretical problem, this lack became painfully clear while
investigating composition models for asynchronous operations.
