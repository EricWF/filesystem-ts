<title>Must <tt>find</tt>'s third argument be CopyConstructible?</title>

<discussion>
<p>Is the following implementation of <tt>find</tt> acceptable?</p>

<pre>
        template&lt;class Iter, class X&gt;
        Iter find(Iter begin, Iter end, const X&amp; x)
        {
            X x1 = x;           // this is the crucial statement
            while (begin != end &amp;&amp; *begin != x1)
                ++begin;
            return begin;
        }
</pre>

<p>If the answer is yes, then it is implementation-dependent as to
whether the following fragment is well formed:</p>

<pre>
        vector&lt;string&gt; v;

        find(v.begin(), v.end(), &quot;foo&quot;);
</pre>

<p>At issue is whether there is a requirement that the third argument
of find be CopyConstructible.  There may be no problem here, but
analysis is necessary.</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>There is no indication in the standard that find's third argument
is required to be Copy Constructible.  The LWG believes that no such
requirement was intended.  As noted above, there are times when a user
might reasonably pass an argument that is not Copy Constructible.</p>
