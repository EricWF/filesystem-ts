<title>clear() complexity for associative containers refers to undefined N</title>

<discussion>
<p>In the associative container requirements table in 23.1.2 paragraph 7,
a.clear() has complexity &quot;log(size()) + N&quot;. However, the meaning of N
is not defined.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In the associative container requirements table in 23.1.2 paragraph
7, the complexity of a.clear(), change &quot;log(size()) + N&quot; to
&quot;linear in <tt>size()</tt>&quot;.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>It's the &quot;log(size())&quot;, not the &quot;N&quot;, that is in
error: there's no difference between <i>O(N)</i> and <i>O(N +
log(N))</i>.  The text in the standard is probably an incorrect
cut-and-paste from the range version of <tt>erase</tt>.</p>
</rationale>
