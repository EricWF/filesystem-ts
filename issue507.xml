<title>Missing requirement for variate_generator::operator()</title>

<p>
Paragraph 11 of [tr.rand.var] equires that the member template
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class T&gt; result_type operator() (T value);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
return
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
distribution()(e, value)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, not all distributions have an operator() with a corresponding signature.
</p>

<note>
Berlin:  As a working group we voted in favor of N1932 which makes this moot:
variate_generator has been eliminated.  Then in full committee we voted to give
this issue WP status (mistakenly).

<resolution>
<p>
We therefore  recommend that we insert the following precondition before paragraph 11:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Precondition:  <tt>distribution().operator()(e,value)</tt> is well-formed.
</p></blockquote>
</resolution>
