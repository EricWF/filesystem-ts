<title>Can't currently clear() empty container</title>

<discussion>
<p>For both sequences and associative containers, a.clear() has the
semantics of erase(a.begin(),a.end()), which is undefined for an empty
container since erase(q1,q2) requires that q1 be dereferenceable
(23.1.1,3 and 23.1.2,7).  When the container is empty, a.begin() is
not dereferenceable.<br/>
<br/>
The requirement that q1 be unconditionally dereferenceable causes many
operations to be intuitively undefined, of which clearing an empty
container is probably the most dire.<br/>
<br/>
Since q1 and q2 are only referenced in the range [q1, q2), and [q1,
q2) is required to be a valid range, stating that q1 and q2 must be
iterators or certain kinds of iterators is unnecessary.

<resolution>
<p>In 23.1.1, paragraph 3, change:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>p and q2 denote valid iterators to a, q and q1 denote valid dereferenceable iterators to a, [q1, q2) denotes a valid range</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>p denotes a valid iterator to a, q denotes a valid dereferenceable iterator to a, [q1, q2) denotes a valid range
  in a</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 23.1.2, paragraph 7, change:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>p and q2 are valid iterators to a, q and q1 are valid dereferenceable
  iterators to a, [q1, q2) is a valid range</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>p is a valid iterator to a, q is a valid dereferenceable iterator to a, [q1, q2) is a valid range
  into a</p>
</blockquote>
