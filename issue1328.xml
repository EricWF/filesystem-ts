<p>
basing on the recent discussion on the library reflector, see c++std-lib-27728
and follow ups, I hereby formally ask for LWG 419 to be re-opened, the rationale
being that according to the current specifications, per
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n3000.pdf">n3000</a>,
it seems actually impossible to seek away from end of file, contrary to the
rationale which led <iref ref="342"/> to its closure as NAD. My request is also
supported by Martin Sebor, and I'd like also to add, as tentative proposed
resolution for the re-opened issue, the wording suggested by Sebor, thus, change
the beginning of <sref ref="[istream::sentry]"/>/2, to:
</p>

<blockquote>
2 <i>Effects:</i> If <tt><ins>(!noskipws &amp;&amp; !</ins>is.good())</tt> is
<tt><del>false</del> <ins>true</ins></tt>, calls <tt>is.setstate(failbit)</tt>.
Otherwise prepares for formatted or unformatted input. ...
