<p><b>Addresses GB-128</b></p>
<p>
WG14 has made some late changes to their specification
of atomics, and care should be taken to ensure that we
retain a common subset of language/library syntax to
declare headers that are portable to both languages.
Ideally, such headers would not require users to define
their own macros, especially not macros that map to
keywords (which remains undefined behaviour)
</p>


<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment
</note>
<p>
Depends on result of the review of WG14 work,
which is expected to be out to ballot during the
time wg21 is resolving its own ballot comments.
Liaison may also want to file comments in WG14
to ensure compatibity from both sides.
