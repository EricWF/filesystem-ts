N3337 <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]"/> contains 2 non-normative notes stating:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[para 4]: &quot;The order of these operations is significant because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> 
may destroy <tt>*this</tt>.&quot;
</p>
<p>
[para 5]: &quot;The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> destroys <tt>*this</tt> since 
<tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems this wording was created to resolve <iref ref="998"/> due to the possibility that a <tt>unique_ptr</tt> may be 
destroyed through deletion of its stored pointer where that directly or indirectly refers to the same <tt>unique_ptr</tt>. 
If <tt>unique_ptr</tt> is required to support circular references then it seems this must be normative text: an implementation 
is currently allowed to operate on <tt>*this</tt> after the assignment and deletion specified in para 4, since this is only 
'disallowed' by the non-normative note.
</p>

<p>I propose the following draft rewording:</p>

<p>
[para 4]: <i>Effects</i>: assigns <tt>p</tt> to the stored pointer, and then if the old value of the stored pointer, <tt>old_p</tt>, was not
equal to <tt>nullptr</tt>, calls <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt>. <ins>No operation shall be performed after the call to 
<tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> that requires <tt>*this</tt> to be valid, because the deletion may destroy <tt>*this</tt> if it is 
referred to directly or indirectly by the stored pointer.</ins> <del>[<i>Note:</i> The order of these operations is significant
because the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt> may destroy <tt>*this</tt>. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
<p/>
[para 5]: <i>Postconditions</i>: <ins>If the call <tt>get_deleter()(old_p)</tt> destroyed <tt>*this</tt>, none. Otherwise,</ins> 
<tt>get() == p</tt>. <del>[<i>Note:</i> The postcondition does not hold if the call to <tt>get_deleter()</tt>
destroys <tt>*this</tt> since <tt>this->get()</tt> is no longer a valid expression. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
</p>

<p>
I expect it will also be necessary to amend the requirements for a deleter, so in addition:
</p>

<p>
<sref ref="[unique.ptr.single]"/> [para 1]: The default type for the template parameter <tt>D</tt> is <tt>default_delete</tt>. 
A client-supplied template argument <tt>D</tt> shall be a function object type (20.10), lvalue-reference to function, or 
lvalue-reference to function object type for which, given a value <tt>d</tt> of type <tt>D</tt> and a value <tt>ptr</tt> of type 
<tt>unique_ptr&lt;T, D&gt;::pointer</tt>, the expression <tt>d(ptr)</tt> is valid and has the effect of disposing of the pointer 
as appropriate for that deleter. <ins>Where <tt>D</tt> is not an lvalue reference type, <tt>d(ptr)</tt> shall be valid if <tt>ptr</tt> 
refers directly or indirectly to the invoking <tt>unique_ptr</tt> object.</ins>
</p>

<note>2013-10-05, Stephan T. Lavavej comments and provides alternative wording</note>
<p>
In Chicago, we determined that the original proposed change to <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single]"/>/1 was insufficient, because 
<tt>d</tt> might be a reference to a deleter functor that's destroyed during self-destruction.
<p/>
We believed that <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]"/>/4 was already sufficiently clear. The Standard occasionally prevents 
implementations of <tt>X</tt> from doing various things, through the principle of "nothing allows <tt>X</tt> to fail in that situation".  
For example, <tt>v.push_back(v[0])</tt> is required to work for non-empty vectors because nothing allows that to fail. In this case, 
the intent to allow self-destruction is already clear.
<p/>
Additionally, we did not believe that <sref ref="[unique.ptr.single.modifiers]"/>/5 had to be changed. The current note is slightly 
squirrely but it does not lead to confusion for implementers or users.
