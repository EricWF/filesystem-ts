<title>Do library implementers have the freedom to add <tt>constexpr</tt>?</title>
<section><sref ref="[constexpr.functions]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Suppose that a particular function is not tagged as constexpr in the standard,
but that, in some particular implementation, it is possible to write it within
the constexpr constraints. If an implementer tags such a function as constexpr,
is that a violation of the standard or is it a conforming extension?</p>

<p>There are two questions to consider. First, is this allowed under the
as-if rule? Second, if it does not fall under as-if, is there
(and should there be) any special license granted to implementers
to do this anyway, sort of the way we allow elision of copy constructors
even though it is detectable by users?</p>

<p>I believe that this does not fall under "as-if", so implementers
probably don't have that freedom today. I suggest changing the WP
to grant it. Even if we decide otherwise, however, I suggest that
we make it explicit.</p>

<resolution>
<p><i>In 17.6.4.6 [constexpr.functions], change paragraph 1 to:</i></p>

<blockquote>
<ins>This standard explicitly requires that certain standard library functions
are <tt>constexpr</tt> [dcl.constexpr].
Additionally, an implementation may declare any function to be <tt>constexpr</tt>
if that function's definition satisfies the necessary constraints.</ins>
Within any header that provides any non-defining declarations of <tt>constexpr</tt>
functions or constructors an implementation shall provide corresponding definitions.
