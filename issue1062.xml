<title>Missing insert_iterator for stacks/queues</title>

<p>
It is odd that we have an iterator to insert into a <tt>vector</tt>, but not an
iterator to insert into a <tt>vector</tt> that is adapted as a <tt>stack</tt>. The standard
container adapters all have a common interface to <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> so it should
be simple to create an iterator adapter to complete the library support.
</p>

<p>
We should provide an <tt>AdaptedContainer</tt> concept supporting <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt>
operations. Create a new insert iterator and factory function that inserts
values into the container by calling <tt>push</tt>.
