<p>
I am trying to understand how TR1 supports hex float (%a) output.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, it does so via the following:
</p>
<p>
8.15 Additions to header &lt;locale&gt; [tr.c99.locale]
</p>
<p>
In subclause <sref ref="[facet.num.put.virtuals]"/>, Table 58 Floating-point conversions, after
the line:
floatfield == ios_base::scientific %E
</p>
<p>
add the two lines:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
floatfield == ios_base::fixed | ios_base::scientific && !uppercase %a
floatfield == ios_base::fixed | ios_base::scientific %A 2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Note: The additional requirements on print and scan functions, later
in this clause, ensure that the print functions generate hexadecimal
floating-point fields with a %a or %A conversion specifier, and that
the scan functions match hexadecimal floating-point fields with a %g
conversion specifier.  end note]
</p>
<p>
Following the thread, in <sref ref="[facet.num.put.virtuals]"/>, we find:
</p>
<p>
For conversion from a floating-point type, if (flags & fixed) != 0 or
if str.precision() > 0, then str.precision() is specified in the
conversion specification.
</p>
<p>
This would seem to imply that when floatfield == fixed|scientific, the
precision of the conversion specifier is to be taken from
str.precision().  Is this really what's intended?  I sincerely hope
that I'm either missing something or this is an oversight.  Please
tell me that the committee did not intend to mandate that hex floats
(and doubles) should by default be printed as if by %.6a.
</p>

<note>
Howard: I think the fundamental issue we overlooked was that with %f,
%e, %g, the default precision was always 6.  With %a the default
precision is not 6, it is infinity.  So for the first time, we need to
distinguish between the default value of precision, and the precision
value 6.

<p>
Leave this open for Robert and Daniel to work on.
</p>
<p>
Straw poll: Disposition?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Default is %.6a (i.e. NAD): 2</li>
<li>Always %a (no precision): 6</li>
<li>precision(-1) == %a: 3</li>
</ul>
<p>
Daniel and Robert have direction to write up wording for the "always %a" solution.

<resolution>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[facet.num.put.virtuals]"/>, Stage 1, under p5 (near the end
of Stage 1):
</p>

<blockquote>
For conversion from a floating-point type, <tt>str.precision()</tt> is specified
<ins>as precision</ins> in the conversion specification
<ins>if <tt>floatfield != (ios_base::fixed | ios_base::scientific)</tt>, else no
precision is specified</ins>.
