<title>Apply <tt>noexcept</tt> judiciously throughout the library</title>

<p>
Since the newly introduced operator <tt>noexcept</tt> makes it
easy (easier than previously) to detect whether or not a
function has been declared with the empty exception
specification (including <tt>noexcept</tt>) library functions that
cannot throw should be decorated with the empty
exception specification. Failing to do so and leaving it as a
matter of QoI would be detrimental to portability and
efficiency.

<p>
Review the whole library, and apply the <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification where it is appropriate.
