<p><b>Addresses GB-63</b></p>
<p>
Since the newly introduced operator noexcept makes it
easy (easier than previously) to detect whether or not a
function has been declared with the empty exception
specification (including noexcept) library functions that
cannot throw should be decorated with the empty
exception specification. Failing to do so and leaving it as a
matter of QoI would be detrimental to portability and
efficiency.
</p>

<resolution>
Review the whole library, and apply the noexcept
specification where it is appropriate.
