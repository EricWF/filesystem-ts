<p><b>Addresses US-95</b></p>
<p>
Copy-assignment for pair is defaulted and does not work
for pairs with reference members. This is inconsistent with
conversion-assignment, which deliberately succeeds even
if one or both elements are reference types, just as for
tuple. The copy-assignment operator should be
consistent with the conversion-assignment operator and
with tuple's assignment operators.
