<title>bitset constructor: incorrect number of initialized bits</title>
<section><sref ref="[bitset.cons]"/></section>

<p>
The constructor from unsigned long says it initializes "the first M
bit positions to the corresponding bit values in val. M is the smaller
of N and the value CHAR_BIT * sizeof(unsigned long)."
</p>

<p>
Object-representation vs. value-representation strikes again. CHAR_BIT *
sizeof (unsigned long) does not give us the number of bits an unsigned long
uses to hold the value. Thus, the first M bit position above is not
guaranteed to have any corresponding bit values in val.

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[bitset.cons]"/> paragraph 2, change "M is the smaller of
  N and the value CHAR_BIT * sizeof (unsigned long). (249)" to
  "<tt>M</tt> is the smaller of <tt>N</tt> and the number of bits in
  the value representation (section <sref ref="[basic.types]"/>) of <tt>unsigned
  long</tt>."
</p>
