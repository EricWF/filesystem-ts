<p>
The requirement "P shall have a declaration of the form <tt>typedef X distribution_- 
type</tt>" effectively makes the use of inheritance for implementing distributions very inconvenient, 
because the child of a distribution class in general will not satisfy this requirement. In my opinion 
the benefits of having a typedef in the parameter class pointing back to the distribution class are 
not worth the hassle this requirement causes. [In my code base I never made use of the nested 
typedef but on several occasions could have profited from being able to use simple inheritance for 
the implementation of a distribution class.]
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposed resolution:</b> I propose to drop this requirement.

Close NAD for the reasons given in N2424. In practice it is not inconvenient to meet these requirements.
