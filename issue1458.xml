<sref ref="[atomics.lockfree]"/> p.8 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
An atomic store shall only store a value that has been computed
from constants and program input values by a finite sequence of
program evaluations, such that each evaluation observes the values
of variables as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
... but <sref ref="[intro.execution]"/> p.13 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced before A,
then A and B are unsequenced. [ <em>Note</em>: The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. &mdash; <em>end note</em> ]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to construct the sequence
described in <sref ref="[atomics.lockfree]"/> p.8. We are not sure of the intention here and do not
offer a suggestion for change, but note that <sref ref="[atomics.lockfree]"/> p.8 is the condition
that prevents out-of-thin-air reads.

<resolution>
<p>
Request the concurrency working group to
determine if changes are needed. Consider
changing the use of "sequence" in <sref ref="[atomics.lockfree]"/>
