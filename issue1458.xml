29.3:8 states:
"An atomic store shall only store a value that has been computed
from constants and program input values by a finite sequence of
program evaluations, such that each evaluation observes the values
of variables as computed by the last prior assignment in the
sequence."
... but 1.9.13 states:
"If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced before A,
then A and B are unsequenced. [ Note: The execution of unsequenced
evaluations can overlap. -end note ]"
Overlapping executions can make it impossible to construct the sequence
described in 29.3:8. We are not sure of the intention here and do not
offer a suggestion for change, but note that 29.3:8 is the condition
that prevents out-of-thin-air reads.

<resolution>
Request the concurrency working group to
determine if changes are needed. Consider
changing the use of "sequence" in 29.3
