<p>
Since the implementation is intended to magically synthesize instances of <tt>std::initializer_list</tt> 
(rather than by a constructor call, for instance), user specializations of this type can't generally be 
made to work. I can't find any wording which makes such specializations ill-formed, though, which leads 
me to suspect that they're technically legal under the provisions of <sref ref="[namespace.std]"/> p1.</p>
