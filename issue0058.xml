<title>Extracting a char from a wide-oriented stream</title>
<section><sref ref="[istream::extractors]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>27.6.1.2.3 has member functions for extraction of signed char and
unsigned char, both singly and as strings. However, it doesn't say
what it means to extract a <tt>char</tt> from a
<tt>basic_streambuf&lt;charT, Traits&gt;</tt>. </p>

<p>basic_streambuf, after all, has no members to extract a char, so
basic_istream must somehow convert from charT to signed char or
unsigned char. The standard doesn't say how it is to perform that
conversion. </p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>The Standard is correct as written.  There is no such extractor and
this is the intent of the LWG.</p>
