<title>unary_negate and binary_negate: struct or class?</title>
<section><sref ref="[function.objects]"/></section>

<p>
In <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> the header &lt;functional&gt; synopsis declares
the unary_negate and binary_negate function objects as struct.
However in <sref ref="[negators]"/> the unary_negate and binary_negate
function objects are defined as class.  Given the context, they are
not "basic function objects" like negate, so this is either a typo or
an editorial oversight.

<resolution>
<p>Change the synopsis to reflect the useage in <sref ref="[negators]"/></p>

<note>Cura&ccedil;ao: Since the language permits &quot;struct&quot;, the LWG
views this as NAD. They suggest, however, that the Project Editor
might wish to make the change as editorial.</note>
