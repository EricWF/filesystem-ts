<rationale>
<p>This is not a defect in the Standard. The LWG has considered this
issue in the past and sees no need to change the Standard. Deque has
no reserve() member function. For vector, shrink-to-fit can be
expressed in a single line of code (where <tt>v</tt> is
<tt>vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>):
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>vector&lt;T&gt;(v).swap(v);&nbsp; // shrink-to-fit v</tt></p>
