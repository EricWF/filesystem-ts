<title>Questionable use of term &quot;inline&quot;</title>

<discussion>
<p>Paragraph 4 of <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;[Example: To negate every element of a: transform(a.begin(), a.end(),
  a.begin(), negate&lt;double&gt;()); The corresponding functions will inline
  the addition and the negation. end example]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: The &quot;addition&quot; referred to in the above is in para 3) we can
find no other wording, except this (non-normative) example which suggests that
any &quot;inlining&quot; will take place in this case.</p>
<p>Indeed both:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>17.4.4.3 Global Functions [lib.global.functions] 1 It is
  unspecified whether any global functions in the C++ Standard Library
  are defined as inline (7.1.2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>17.4.4.4 Member Functions [lib.member.functions] 1 It is
  unspecified whether any member functions in the C++ Standard Library
  are defined as inline (7.1.2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>take care to state that this may indeed NOT be the case.</p>
<p>Thus the example &quot;mandates&quot; behavior that is explicitly
not required elsewhere.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> paragraph 1, remove the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are important for the effective use of the library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remove <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> paragraph 2, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Using function objects together with function templates
  increases the expressive power of the library as well as making the
  resulting code much more efficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <sref ref="[function.objects]"/> paragraph 4, remove the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The corresponding functions will inline the addition and the
  negation.</p>
</blockquote>
