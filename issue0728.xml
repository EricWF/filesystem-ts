<p>
The <tt>mersenne_twister_engine</tt> is required to use a seeding method that is given 
as an algorithm parameterized over the number of bits <tt>W</tt>. I doubt whether the given generalization 
of an algorithm that was originally developed only for unsigned 32-bit integers is appropriate 
for other bit widths. For instance, <tt>W</tt> could be theoretically 16 and <tt>UIntType</tt> a 16-bit integer, in 
which case the given multiplier would not fit into the <tt>UIntType</tt>. Moreover, T. Nishimura and M. 
Matsumoto have chosen a dif ferent multiplier for their 64 bit Mersenne Twister
[<a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/VERSIONS/C-LANG/mt19937-64.c">reference</a>].
</p>

<p>
I see two possible resolutions: 
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>Restrict the parameter <tt>W</tt> of the <tt>mersenne_twister_template</tt> to values of 32 or 64 and use the 
multiplier from [the above reference] for the 64-bit case (my preference)</li>
<li>Interpret the state array for any <tt>W</tt> as a 32-bit array of appropriate length (and a specified byte 
order) and always employ the 32-bit algorithm for seeding
</li>
</ol>

for further discussion.

<blockquote>
<p>
Stephan Tolksdorf has additional comments on N2424. He comments: "there
is a typo in the required behaviour for mt19937_64: It should be the
10000th (not 100000th) invocation whose value is given, and the value
should be 9981545732273789042 (not 14002232017267485025)." These values
need checking.
</p>
<p>
Take the proposed recommendation in N2424 and move to REVIEW.

<blockquote><p>
I support the proposed resolution in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2424.pdf">N2424</a>,
but there is a typo in the
required behaviour for <tt>mt19937_64</tt>: It should be the 10000<sup>th</sup> (not
100000<sup>th</sup>) invocation whose value is given, and the value should be
9981545732273789042 (not 14002232017267485025). The change to para. 8
proposed by Charles Karney should also be included in the proposed
wording.
