<title>Longjmp wording problem</title>

<p>
The wording for <tt>longjmp</tt> is confusing.
</p>
<p>
<sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> -4- Other runtime support
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The function signature <tt>longjmp(jmp_buf jbuf, int val)</tt> has more restricted
behavior in this International Standard.  If any automatic objects would
be destroyed by a thrown exception transferring control to another
(destination) point in the program, then a call to <tt>longjmp(jbuf, val)</tt> that
the throw point that transfers control to the same (destination) point has
undefined behavior.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Someone at Google thinks that should say "then a call to <tt>longjmp(jbuf, val)</tt>
*at* the throw point that transfers control".
</p>
<p>
Bill Gibbons thinks it should say something like "If any automatic objects
would be destroyed by an exception thrown at the point of the longjmp and
caught only at the point of the setjmp, the behavior is undefined."
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
In general, accept Bill Gibbons' recommendation,
but add "call" to indicate that the undefined behavior
comes from the dynamic call, not from its presence in the code.
In <sref ref="[support.runtime]"/> paragraph 4, change
</p>

<blockquote><p>
