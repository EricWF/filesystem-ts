<title>Lifetime of exception::what() return unspecified</title>

<discussion>
<p>In 18.6.1, paragraphs 8-9, the lifetime of the return value of
exception::what() is left unspecified. This issue has implications
with exception safety of exception handling: some exceptions should
not throw bad_alloc.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add to <sref ref="[type.info]"/> paragraph 9 (exception::what notes
clause) the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The return value remains valid until the exception object from which it is obtained is
  destroyed or a non-const member function of the exception object is called.</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>If an exception object has non-const members, they may be used
to set internal state that should affect the contents of the string
returned by <tt>what()</tt>.
</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
