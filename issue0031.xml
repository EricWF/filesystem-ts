<discussion>
<p>POSIX guarantees some kind of atomicity for rename().</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Clarify that POSIX' rename() guarantee "If the rename() function fails for any
reason other than [EIO], any file named by new shall be unaffected." holds for
C++ as well.</p>

  <note>2014-02-10 Beman Dawes</note>

  <p/>Section 2.1, POSIX conformance, [fs.conform.9945] specifies the POSIX conformance requirements for TS
  implementations in carefully crafted and specific detail. Repeating a portion of the POSIX standard's
  specification for a particular TS function would do great harm as it would bring into question all of
  the portions of the POSIX specification for the function that were not repeated.
  
  <p/>Furthermore, all the caveats and other details of the 2.1 specification would have to be analysed
  and possibly appended; it ties the hands of implementors if they are not given latitude to deviate as needed
  when working with non-POSIX operating systems.
  
  <p/>I strongly recommend NAD for this issue.s
