<title>Immutable locale values</title>
<section><sref ref="[locale]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Paragraph 6, says &quot;An instance of <tt>locale</tt> is
<i>immutable</i>; once a facet reference is obtained from it,
...&quot;. This has caused some confusion, because locale variables
are manifestly assignable. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[locale]"/> replace paragraph 6</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An instance of <tt>locale</tt> is immutable; once a facet
  reference is obtained from it, that reference remains usable as long
  as the locale value itself exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once a facet reference is obtained from a locale object by
  calling use_facet&lt;&gt;, that reference remains usable, and the
  results from member functions of it may be cached and re-used, as
  long as some locale object refers to that facet.</p>
