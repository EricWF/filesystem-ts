22.2.2.2.2, p12 specifies that <tt>thousands_sep</tt> is to be inserted only
for integral types (issue 282 suggests that this should be done for
all arithmetic types).
</p>

<p>
22.2.2.1.2, p12 requires that grouping be checked for all extractors
including that for <tt>void*</tt>.
</p>

<p>
I don't think that's right. <tt>void*</tt> values should not be checked for
grouping, should they? (Although if they should, then <tt>num_put</tt> needs
to write them out, otherwise their extraction will fail.)

<resolution>
<p>
Change the first sentence of 22.2.2.2.2, p12 from
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Digit grouping is checked. That is, the positions of discarded
    separators is examined for consistency with
    use_facet&lt;numpunct&lt;charT&gt; &gt;(loc).grouping().
    If they are not consistent then ios_base::failbit is assigned
    to err.
</p></blockquote>

<p>to</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Except for conversions to void*, digit grouping is checked...
</p></blockquote>

</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>This would be a change: as it stands, the standard clearly
  specifies that grouping applies to void*.  A survey of existing
  practice shows that most existing implementations do that, as they
  should.</p>
</rationale>
