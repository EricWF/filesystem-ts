<p>
According to C.2.2.3, p1, "the macro NULL, defined in any of &lt;clocale&gt;,
&lt;cstddef&gt;, &lt;cstdio&gt;, &lt;cstdlib&gt;, &lt;cstring&gt;, &lt;ctime&gt;,
or &lt;cwchar&gt;." This is consistent with the C standard.
</p>
<p>
However, Table 95 in C.2 fails to mention &lt;clocale&gt; and &lt;cstdlib&gt;.
</p>
<p>
In addition, C.2, p2 claims that "The C++ Standard library provides
54 standard macros from the C library, as shown in Table 95." While
table 95 does have 54 entries, since a couple of them (including the
NULL macro) are listed more than once, the actual number of macros
defined by the C++ Standard Library may not be 54.

<resolution>
<p>
I propose we add &lt;clocale&gt; and &lt;cstdlib&gt; to Table 96 and remove the
number of macros from C.2, p2 and reword the sentence as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The C++ Standard library <del>provides 54 standard macros from</del>
<ins>defines a number macros corresponding to those defined by</ins> the C 
<ins>Standard</ins> library, as shown in Table 96.
</p></blockquote>
