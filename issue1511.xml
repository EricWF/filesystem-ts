<p>
According to the definition of <tt>atomic_future</tt>, all members
of <tt>atomic_future</tt> are synchronizing except constructors.
However, it would probably be appropriate for a move
constructor to be synchronizing on the source object. If
not, the postconditions on paragraphs 7-8, might not be
satisfied. This may be applicable if a collection of futures
are being doled out to a set of threads that process their
value.
