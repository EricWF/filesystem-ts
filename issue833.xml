<p>
Once the C++0x standard library is feature complete, the LWG needs to
review <sref ref="[compliance]"/> Freestanding implementations header list to
ensure it reflects LWG consensus.

<p>
This is a placeholder defect to remind us to review the table once we've
stopped adding headers to the library.
</p>
<p>
Three new headers that need to be added to the list:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;initializer_list&gt; &lt;concept&gt; &lt;iterator_concepts&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>&lt;iterator_concepts&gt;</tt>, in particular, has lots of stuff
that isn't needed, so maybe the stuff that is needed should be broken
out into a separate header.
</p>
<p>
Robert: What about <tt>reference_closure</tt>? It's currently in
<tt>&lt;functional&gt;</tt>.

<li>
The comment regarding <tt>reference_closure</tt> seems moot since it was just
recently decided to remove that.

A reference to proposal
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2814.pdf">N2814</a>
("Fixing freestanding") should be added. This
paper e.g. proposes to add only <tt>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</tt> to the include list
of freestanding.
