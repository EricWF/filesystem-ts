<title>offsetof macro and non-POD types</title>

<discussion> 
<p>Spliced together from reflector messages c++std-lib-8294 and -8295:</p>

<p>18.1, paragraph 5, reads: &quot;The macro <tt>offsetof</tt>
accepts a restricted set of <i>type</i> arguments in this
International Standard. <i>type</i> shall be a POD structure or a POD
union (clause 9). The result of applying the offsetof macro to a field
that is a static data member or a function member is
undefined.&quot;</p>

<p>For the POD requirement, it doesn't say &quot;no diagnostic
required&quot; or &quot;undefined behavior&quot;. I read <sref ref="[intro.compliance]"/>, paragraph 1, to mean that a diagnostic is required.
It's not clear whether this requirement was intended.  While it's
possible to provide such a diagnostic, the extra complication doesn't
seem to add any value.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change 18.1, paragraph 5, to &quot;If <i>type</i> is not a POD
structure or a POD union the results are undefined.&quot;</p>

<note>Copenhagen: straw poll was 7-4 in favor.  It was generally
agreed that requiring a diagnostic was inadvertent, but some LWG
members thought that diagnostics should be required whenever
possible.</note>
