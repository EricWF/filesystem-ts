<p>
Specifications now expressed via narrative text are more accurately and
clearly expressed via executable code.
</p>
<p>
Wherever concepts are available that directly match this section's type
traits, express the traits in terms of the concepts instead of via
narrative text. Where the type traits do not quite match the
corresponding concepts, bring the two into alignment so as to avoid two
nearly-identical notions.

We think that this is a good idea, but it requires a lot of work. If someone
submits a paper proposing specific changes, we would be happy to review it
at the next meeting.
