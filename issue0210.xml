<discussion>
<p>In paragraph 9 of section <sref ref="[algorithms]"/>, it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>      In the description of the algorithms operators + and - are used
           for some of the iterator categories for which they do not have to
           be defined. In these cases the semantics of [...] a-b is the same
           as of<br/>
  <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>return distance(a, b);</tt></p>
</blockquote>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>On the last line of paragraph 9 of section <sref ref="[algorithms]"/> change
<tt>&quot;a-b&quot;</tt> to <tt>&quot;b-a&quot;.</tt></p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>There are two ways to fix the defect; change the description to b-a
or change the return to distance(b,a).  The LWG preferred the
former for consistency.</p>
</rationale>
