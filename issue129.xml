<title>Need error indication from seekp() and seekg()</title>

<discussion>
<p>Currently, the standard does not specify how seekg() and seekp()
indicate failure. They are not required to set failbit, and they can't
return an error indication because they must return *this, i.e. the
stream. Hence, it is undefined what happens if they fail. And they
<i>can</i> fail, for instance, when a file stream is disconnected from the
underlying file (is_open()==false) or when a wide character file
stream must perform a state-dependent code conversion, etc. </p>

<p>The stream functions seekg() and seekp() should set failbit in the
stream state in case of failure.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add to the Effects: clause of&nbsp; seekg() in 
<sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> and to the Effects: clause of seekp() in
<sref ref="[ostream.seeks]"/>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case of failure, the function calls <tt>setstate(failbit)</tt> (which may throw <tt>ios_base::failure</tt>).
  </p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>Setting failbit is the usual error reporting mechanism for streams</p>
</rationale>
</issue>
