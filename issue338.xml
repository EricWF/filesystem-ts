<title> is whitespace allowed between `-' and a digit?</title>

<p>
From Stage 2 processing in <sref ref="[facet.num.get.virtuals]"/>, p8 and 9 (the
original text or the text corrected by the proposed resolution of
issue <iref ref="221"/>) it seems clear that no whitespace is allowed
within a number, but <sref ref="[locale.numpunct]"/>, p2, which gives the
format for integer and floating point values, says that whitespace is
optional between a plusminus and a sign.
</p>

<p>
The text needs to be clarified to either consistently allow or
disallow whitespace between a plusminus and a sign. It might be
worthwhile to consider the fact that the C library stdio facility does
not permit whitespace embedded in numbers and neither does the C or
C++ core language (the syntax of integer-literals is given in <sref ref="[lex.icon]"/>, that of floating-point-literals in <sref ref="[lex.fcon]"/> of the C++ standard).

<resolution>
<p>Change the first part of <sref ref="[locale.numpunct]"/> paragraph 2 from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The syntax for number formats is as follows, where <tt>digit</tt>
represents the radix set specified by the <tt>fmtflags</tt> argument
value, <tt>whitespace</tt> is as determined by the facet
<tt>ctype&lt;charT&gt;</tt> (22.2.1.1), and <tt>thousands-sep</tt> and
<tt>decimal-point</tt> are the results of corresponding
<tt>numpunct&lt;charT&gt;</tt> members.  Integer values have the
format:
</p>
<pre>
  integer   ::= [sign] units
  sign      ::= plusminus [whitespace]
  plusminus ::= '+' | '-'
  units     ::= digits [thousands-sep units]
  digits    ::= digit [digits]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<rationale>
<p>It's not clear whether the format described in <sref ref="[locale.numpunct]"/> paragraph 2 has any normative weight: nothing in the
standard says how, or whether, it's used.  However, there's no reason
for it to differ gratuitously from the very specific description of
numeric processing in <sref ref="[facet.num.get.virtuals]"/>.  The proposed
resolution removes all mention of "whitespace" from that format.</p>
