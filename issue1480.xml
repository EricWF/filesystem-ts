<p>
Thread fence not only establish synchronizes with relationships,
there are semantics of fences that are expressed not in
terms of <em>synchronizes with</em> relationships (for example see <sref ref="[atomics.order]"/> p.5).
These semantics also need to apply to the use of
<tt>atomic_signal_fence</tt> in a restricted way.

<note>Batavia: Concurrency group discussed issue, and is OK with the proposed resolution.</note>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[atomics.fences]"/> p. 6 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void atomic_signal_fence(memory_order);  
</pre><blockquote><p>
6 <em>Effects</em>: equivalent to <tt>atomic_thread_fence(order)</tt>, except that <del>synchronizes 
with relationships</del><ins>the resulting ordering constraints</ins> are established only between a 
thread and a signal handler executed in the same thread.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
