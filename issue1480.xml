Thread fence not only establish synchronizes with relationships,
there are semantics of fences that are expressed not in
terms of <em>synchronizes with</em> relationships (for example see <sref ref="[atomics.order]"/> p.5).
These semantics also need to apply to the use of
<tt>atomic_signal_fence</tt> in a restricted way.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Change <sref ref="[atomics.fences]"/> p. 6 as indicated:
<blockquote><pre>
void atomic_signal_fence(memory_order);  
</pre><blockquote>
6 <em>Effects</em>: equivalent to <tt>atomic_thread_fence(order)</tt>, except that <del>synchronizes 
with relationships</del><ins>the resulting ordering constraints</ins> are established only between a 
thread and a signal handler executed in the same thread.
</blockquote></blockquote>
</resolution>
