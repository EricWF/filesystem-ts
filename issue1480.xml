<discussion>
Thread fence not only establish synchronizes with
relationships,
there are semantics of fences that are expressed not in
terms of
synchronizes with relationships (for example see 29.3p5).
These semantics also need to apply to the use of
atomic_signal_fence in a restricted way.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Change 29.8p6 to "Effects: equivalent to
atomic_thread_fence(order), except that the
resulting ordering constraints are
established only between a thread and a signal
handler executed in the same thread."
</resolution>
