Motivation:
</p>

<p>
This requirement seems obvious to me, it is the essence of code modularity. 
I have complained to Mr. Plauger that the Dinkumware library does not 
observe this principle but he objected that this behaviour is not covered in 
the standard.

<resolution>
<p>
Append the following point to 22.1.1.1.1:
</p>

<p>
6. The implementation of a facet of Table 52 parametrized with an 
InputIterator/OutputIterator should use that iterator only as character 
source/sink respectively.
For a *_get facet, it means that the value received depends only on the 
sequence of input characters and not on how they are accessed.
For a *_put facet, it means that the sequence of characters output depends 
only on the value to be formatted and not of how the characters are stored.

Berlin:  Moved to Open, Need to clean up this area to make it clear
locales don't have to contain open ended sets of facets. Jack, Howard,
Bill.
