<p><b>Addresses GB-125</b></p>

<p>The term "target sequence" is not defined (<sref ref="[re.results.acc]"/> p. 2).</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:

<p>
Replace "target sequence" with "string being searched/matched"
</p>

<p>
The proposed resolution looks incomplete to me, there are more normative
usages of the term <em>target sequence</em> in clause 28, e.g.
<sref ref="[re.tokiter]"/> p. 7.

<resolution>
<p>
Wording changes are against N3126. They are intended not to conflict with the wording changes
suggested by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3158.html">n3158</a>.
</p>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[re.results.acc]"/> p. 2 as indicated:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
difference_type position(size_type sub = 0) const;
</pre><blockquote><p>
2 <em>Returns</em>: The distance from the start of the <del>target sequence</del><ins>string being matched</ins> to <tt>(*this)[sub].first</tt>.
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
</resolution>
