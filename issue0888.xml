<title><tt>this_thread::yield</tt> too strong</title>

<p>
I never thought I'd say this, but <tt>this_thread::yield</tt> seems to be too
strong in specification.  The issue is that some systems distinguish
between yielding to another thread in the same process and yielding
to another process.  Given that the C++ standard only talks about
a single program, one can infer that the specification allows yielding
only to another thread within the same program.  Posix has no
facility for that behavior.  Can you please file an issue to weaken
the wording.  Perhaps "Offers the operating system the opportunity
to reschedule."
