<p>
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> p3 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"All of the containers defined in this Clause and in (21.4) except <tt>array</tt> meet the additional requirements 
of an allocator-aware container, as described in Table 99."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Is this true of <tt>dynarray</tt>?  I believe the answer must be no because <tt>dynarray</tt> has no <tt>allocator_type</tt>, 
and morally should be no, so that operations are defined in terms of <tt>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</tt>, which p13 says
doesn't actually need to be used (which allows the elements to be default-initialized as is intended, rather than 
"default-inserted into the container" using an allocator.)
<p/>
The requirement that "each element is constructed with uses-allocator construction" provides roughly equivalent behaviour 
to the "<em>CopyInsertable into <tt>X</tt></em>" requirements for allocator-aware containers, allowing an allocator to 
control construction of the <tt>dynarray</tt> elements.
