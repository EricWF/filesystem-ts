<title>adjustfield lacks default value</title>

<discussion>
<p>There is no initial value for the adjustfield defined, although
many people believe that the default adjustment were right. This is a
common misunderstanding. The standard only defines that, if no
adjustment is specified, all the predefined inserters must add fill
characters before the actual value, which is &quot;as if&quot; the
right flag were set. The flag itself need not be set.</p>

<p>When you implement a user-defined inserter you cannot rely on right
being the default setting for the adjustfield. Instead, you must be
prepared to find none of the flags set and must keep in mind that in
this case you should make your inserter behave &quot;as if&quot; the
right flag were set. This is surprising to many people and complicates
matters more than necessary.</p>

<p>Unless there is a good reason why the adjustfield should not be
initialized I would suggest to give it the default value that
everybody expects anyway.</p>

<rationale>
<p>This is not a defect. It is deliberate that the default is no bits
set. Consider Arabic or Hebrew, for example. See <sref ref="[facet.num.put.virtuals]"/> paragraph 19, Table 61 - Fill padding.</p>
