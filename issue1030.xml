<p><b>Addresses JP 44</b></p>

<p>
The 1st parameter <tt>p</tt> and 2nd parameter <tt>v</tt> is now
<tt>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;*</tt>.
</p>
<p>
It should be <tt>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp;</tt>, or if these are
<tt>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;*</tt> then add the "<tt>p</tt> shall not be a
null pointer" at the requires.

<blockquote><p>
Agree. All of the functions need a requirement that <tt>p</tt> (or
<tt>v</tt>) is a pointer to a valid object.

<blockquote>
<p>
Lawrence explained that these signatures match the regular atomics. The
regular atomics must not use references because these signatures are
shared with C. The decision to pass shared_ptrs by pointer rather than
by reference was deliberate and was motivated by the principle of least
surprise.
</p>
<p>
Lawrence to write wording that requires that the pointers not be null.
</p>

2009-09-20 Lawrence provided wording:
</note>

<blockquote>
<p>
The parameter types for atomic shared pointer access
were deliberately chosen to be pointers
to match the corresponding parameters of the atomics chapter.
Those in turn were deliberately chosen
to match C functions,
which do not have reference parameters.
</p>
<p>
We adopt the second suggestion,
to require that such pointers not be null.

<resolution>
<p>
In section "<code>shared_ptr</code> atomic access"
<sref ref="[util.smartptr.shared.atomic]"/>, add to each function the
following clause.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Requires:</i> <code>p</code> shall not be null.
