<discussion>
The mutex requirements force try_lock to be
noexcept(true). However, where they are used by the
generic algorithms, those relax this requirement and say
that try_lock may throw. This means the requirement is
too stringent, also a non-throwing try_lock does not allow
for a diagnostic such as system_error that lock() will give
us.
