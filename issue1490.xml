<title>Mutex requirements too stringent</title>

<p>
The mutex requirements force <tt>try_lock</tt> to be
<tt>noexcept(true)</tt>. However, where they are used by the
generic algorithms, those relax this requirement and say
that <tt>try_lock</tt> may throw. This means the requirement is
too stringent, also a non-throwing <tt>try_lock</tt> does not allow
for a diagnostic such as <tt>system_error</tt> that <tt>lock()</tt> 
will give us.
