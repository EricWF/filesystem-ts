<title>Inconsistent types for <tt>basic_istream::ignore()</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>In <sref ref="[istream]"/> the function
<tt>ignore()</tt> gets an object of type <tt>streamsize</tt> as first
argument. However, in <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/>
paragraph 23 the first argument is of type <tt>int.</tt></p>

<p>As far as I can see this is not really a contradiction because
everything is consistent if <tt>streamsize</tt> is typedef to be
<tt>int</tt>. However, this is almost certainly not what was
intended. The same thing happened to <tt>basic_filebuf::setbuf()</tt>,
as described in issue <iref ref="173"/>.</p>

<p>Darin Adler also
submitted this issue, commenting: Either 27.6.1.1 should be modified
to show a first parameter of type int, or 27.6.1.3 should be modified
to show a first parameter of type streamsize and use
numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> paragraph 23 and 24, change both uses
of <tt>int</tt> in the description of <tt>ignore()</tt> to
<tt>streamsize</tt>.</p>
