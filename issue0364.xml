<discussion>
<p>
<sref ref="[streambuf.virt.buffer]"/> paragraph 1 is inconsistent with the Effects
clause for seekoff.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
Make this paragraph, the Effects clause for setbuf, consistent in wording
with the Effects clause for seekoff in paragraph 3 by amending paragraph 1
to indicate the purpose of setbuf:
</p>

<p>Original text:</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 Effects: Performs an operation that is defined separately for each
class derived from basic_streambuf in this clause (27.7.1.3, 27.8.1.4).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Proposed text:</p>

<blockquote><p>
1 Effects: Influences stream buffering in a way that is defined separately
for each class derived from basic_streambuf in this clause
(27.7.1.3, 27.8.1.4).
</p></blockquote>

</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG doesn't believe there is any normative difference between
  the existing wording and what's in the proposed resolution, but the
  change may make the intent clearer.</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
