<title>operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp;, string&amp;) doesn't set failbit</title>
<section><sref ref="[string.io]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The description of the stream extraction operator for std::string (section
21.3.7.9 [lib.string.io]) does not contain a requirement that failbit be set in
the case that the operator fails to extract any characters from the input
stream.</p>
<p>This implies that the typical construction</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>std::istream is;
std::string str;
...
while (is &gt;&gt; str) ... ;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>(which tests failbit) is not required to terminate at EOF.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is inconsistent with other extraction operators,
which do include this requirement. (See sections <sref ref="[istream.formatted]"/> and <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/>), where this
requirement is present, either explicitly or implicitly, for the
extraction operators. It is also present explicitly in the description
of getline (istream&amp;, string&amp;, charT) in section <sref ref="[string.io]"/> paragraph 8.)</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Insert new paragraph after paragraph 2 in section <sref ref="[string.io]"/>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If the function extracts no characters, it calls
is.setstate(ios::failbit) which may throw ios_base::failure
(27.4.4.3).</p>
</blockquote>
