<p>
<tt>condition_varible::wait()</tt> (and, presumably, <tt>condition_variable_any::wait()</tt>, although 
I haven't looked at it) says that it calls <tt>lock.unlock()</tt>, and if <tt>condition_variable::wait()</tt> 
exits by an exception it calls <tt>lock.lock()</tt> on the way out. But if the initial call to 
<tt>lock.unlock()</tt> threw an exception, does it make sense to call <tt>lock.lock()</tt>? We simply 
don't know the state of that lock object, and it's probably better not to touch it.
<p/>
That aside, once the <tt>wait()</tt> call has been unblocked, it calls <tt>lock.lock()</tt>. If <tt>lock.lock()</tt> 
throws an exception, what happens? The requirement is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If the function exits via an exception, <tt>lock.lock()</tt> shall be called prior to exiting the function scope.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That can be read in two different ways. One way is as if it said "<tt>lock.lock()</tt> shall have been called …", 
i.e. the original, failed, call to <tt>lock.lock()</tt> is all that's required. But a more natural reading is 
that wait has to call <tt>lock.lock()</tt> again, even though it already failed.
<p/>
I think this wording suffers from being too general. There are two possible exception sources: the initial call 
to <tt>lock.unlock()</tt> and the final call to <tt>lock.lock()</tt>. Each one should have its own requirement. 
Lumping them together muddles things.
