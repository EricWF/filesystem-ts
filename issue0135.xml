<discussion>
<p>-1- Effects Constructs an object of class basic_iostream, assigning
initial values to the base classes by calling
basic_istream&lt;charT,traits&gt;(sb) (lib.istream) and
basic_ostream&lt;charT,traits&gt;(sb) (lib.ostream)</p>

<p>The called for basic_istream and basic_ostream constructors call
init(sb). This means that the basic_iostream's virtual base class is
initialized twice.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change 27.6.1.5.1, paragraph 1 to:</p>

<p>-1- Effects Constructs an object of class basic_iostream, assigning
initial values to the base classes by calling
basic_istream&lt;charT,traits&gt;(sb) (lib.istream).</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG agreed that the <tt> init()</tt> function is called
twice, but said that this is harmless and so not a defect in the
standard.</p>
</rationale>
