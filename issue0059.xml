<title>Ambiguity in specification of gbump</title>
<section><sref ref="[streambuf.get.area]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>27.5.2.3.1 says that basic_streambuf::gbump() &quot;Advances the
next pointer for the input sequence by n.&quot; </p>

<p>The straightforward interpretation is that it is just gptr() +=
n. An alternative interpretation, though, is that it behaves as if it
calls sbumpc n times. (The issue, of course, is whether it might ever
call underflow.) There is a similar ambiguity in the case of
pbump. </p>

<p>(The &quot;classic&quot; AT&amp;T implementation used the
former interpretation.)</p>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[streambuf.get.area]"/> paragraph 4 gbump effects from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Advances the next pointer for the input sequence by n.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Adds <tt>n</tt> to the next pointer for the input sequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make the same change to <sref ref="[streambuf.put.area]"/> paragraph 4 pbump
effects.</p>
</resolution>
