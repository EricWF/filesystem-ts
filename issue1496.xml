Requiring wait_until makes it impossible to implement
condition_variable correctly using respective objects
provided by the operating system (i.e. implementing the
native_handle() function) on many platforms (e.g. POSIX,
Windows, MacOS X) or using the same object as for the
condition variable proposed for C.
