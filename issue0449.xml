<p>Original text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The macro offsetof accepts a restricted set of type arguments in this
International Standard. type shall be a POD structure or a POD union
(clause 9). The result of applying the offsetof macro to a field that
is a static data member or a function member is undefined."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Revised text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"If type is not a POD structure or a POD union the results are undefined."
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Looks to me like the revised text should have replaced only the second
sentence. It doesn't make sense standing alone.

<resolution>
<p>Change 18.1, paragraph 5, to:</p>

<blockquote><p>
The macro offsetof accepts a restricted set of type arguments in this
International Standard.  If type is not a POD structure or a POD union
the results are undefined.  The result of applying the offsetof macro
to a field that is a static data member or a function member is
undefined."
