<title>Exception-handling policy for unformatted output</title>

<discussion>
<p>Clause 27 details an exception-handling policy for formatted input,
unformatted input, and formatted output. It says nothing for
unformatted output (27.6.2.6). 27.6.2.6 should either include the same
kind of exception-handling policy as in the other three places, or
else it should have a footnote saying that the omission is
deliberate. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>
In 27.6.2.6, paragraph 1, replace the last sentence (&quot;In any
case, the unformatted output function ends by destroying the sentry
object, then returning the value specified for the formatted output
function.&quot;) with the following text:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If an exception is thrown during output, then <tt>ios::badbit</tt> is
turned on [Footnote: without causing an <tt>ios::failure</tt> to be
thrown.] in <tt>*this</tt>'s error state. If <tt>(exceptions() &amp;
badbit) != 0</tt> then the exception is rethrown.  In any case, the
unformatted output function ends by destroying the sentry object,
then, if no exception was thrown, returning the value specified for
the formatted output function.
</p></blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>
This exception-handling policy is consistent with that of formatted
input, unformatted input, and formatted output.
</p>
</rationale>
