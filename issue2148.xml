<p>
The <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3333.html">paper</a> 
proposes various hashing improvements. What it doesn't mention is hashing of
enums; enums are integral types, and users expect them to have built-in hashing
support, rather than having to convert enums to ints for uses with
unordered containers and other uses of hashes. Daniel Kr&uuml;gler explains in c++std-lib-32412
that this is not achievable with a SFINAEd hash specialization because it would require
a partial specialization with a type parameter and a non-type parameter with a
default argument, which is currently not allowed, and hence the fixes in N3333 should be
adopted instead.

<p>
We agree this is a real issue that should be resolved, by specifying such a hash.
</p>

<p>
It is not clear that we should specify this as calling hash on the <tt>underlying_type</tt>,
or whether that is overspecification and we merely require that the hash be supplied.
</p>

<p>
STL already has shipped an implementation, and is keen to provide wording.
