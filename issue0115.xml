<p>D.7.4.1 strstream constructors paragraph 2 says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Constructs an object of class strstream, initializing the base class with
  iostream(&amp; sb) and initializing sb with one of the two constructors: </p>
  <p>- If mode&amp;app==0, then s shall designate the first element of an array of n
  elements. The constructor is strstreambuf(s, n, s). </p>
  <p>- If mode&amp;app==0, then s shall designate the first element of an array of n
  elements that contains an NTBS whose first element is designated by s. The constructor is
  strstreambuf(s, n, s+std::strlen(s)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the second condition is the same as the first. I think the second condition
should be &quot;If mode&amp;app==app&quot;, or &quot;mode&amp;app!=0&quot;, meaning that
the append bit is set.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[depr.ostrstream.cons]"/> paragraph 2 and <sref ref="[depr.strstream.cons]"/>
paragraph 2, change the first condition to <tt>(mode&amp;app)==0</tt>
and the second condition to <tt>(mode&amp;app)!=0</tt>.</p>
</resolution>
