<p><b>Addresses DE-20</b></p>

The library component monotonic_clock is conditionally
supported, but no compile-time flag exists that allows
user-code to query its existence. Further-on there exist no
portable means to simulate such a query. (To do so, user
code would be required to add types to namespace
std::chrono.)
</discussion>

<resolution>
Provide a compile-time flag (preferably a macro)
that can be used to query the existence of
monotonic_clock.
