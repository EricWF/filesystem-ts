<title>Imbue() and getloc() Returns clauses swapped</title>

<p>Section 27.4.2.3 specifies how imbue() and getloc() work. That
section has two RETURNS clauses, and they make no sense as
stated. They make perfect sense, though, if you swap them. Am I
correct in thinking that paragraphs 2 and 4 just got mixed up by
accident?</p>
