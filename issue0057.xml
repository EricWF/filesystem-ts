<title>[PDTS] Inappropriate use of "No diagnostic is required"</title>

<p/>§ 2.1 [fs.conform.9945] specifes "No diagnostic is required" for races. That prescription is
used by the standard for the core language; it is not appropriate in library specifications.
LWG/SG-3 wishes this be changed to undefined behavior.

<note>Beman comments: The replacment wording is similar to that used by C++14 17.6.4.10</note>

<resolution>
<p/>Change the following paragraph from § 2.1 [fs.conform.9945]
<blockquote>
<del>The behavior of functions described in this Technical Specification may differ
from their specification in the presence of file system races ([fs.def.race]).
No diagnostic is required.</del>
<p/><ins>Behavior is undefined if calls to functions provided
by this Technical Specification introduce a file system race (4.6 [fs.def.race]).</ins>
</blockquote>

<p/>Insert a new sub-section head before the modified paragraph:
<blockquote>2.1 File system race behavior [fs.race.behavior]</blockquote>

</resolution>
