<title>[FCD] constructible/convertible traits and access control</title>

<p>
Several type traits require compiler support, e.g.
<tt>std::is_constructible</tt> or <tt>std::is_convertible</tt>.
Their current specification seems to imply, that the corresponding
test expressions should be well-formed, even in absense of access:
</p>
<pre>
class X { X(int){} };
constexpr bool test = std::is_constructible&lt;X, int>::value;
</pre>
<p>
The specification does not clarify the context of this test
and because it already goes beyond normal language
rules, it's hard to argue by means of normal language
rules what the context and outcome of the test should be.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment

<p>
Specify that <tt>std::is_constructible</tt> and
<tt>std::is_convertible</tt> will return <tt>true</tt> only for
public constructors/conversion functions.
