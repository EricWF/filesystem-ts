<discussion>
While std::pair may happen to hold a pair of iterators
forming a valid range, this is more likely a coincidence
than a feature guaranteed by the semantics of the pair
template. A distinct range-type should be supplied to
enable the new for-loop syntax rather than overloading an
existing type with a different semantic.

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

<resolution>
Strike 20.3.5.4 and the matching declarations in
20.3 header synopsis.
If a replacement facility is required for C++0x,
consider n2995.
