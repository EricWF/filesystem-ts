<discussion>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the locale examples is a description of part of an
implementation technique that has lost its referent, and doesn't mean
anything. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Delete <sref ref="[facets.examples]"/> paragraph 3 which begins &quot;This
initialization/identification system depends...&quot;, or (at the
editor's option) replace it with a place-holder to keep the paragraph
numbering the same. </p>
</resolution>
