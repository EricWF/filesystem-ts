<title><tt>std::reverse_iterator</tt> should be a literal type</title>

<p>
<tt>std::reverse_iterator::reverse_iterator(Iterator)</tt> should be constexpr
so that other constexpr functions can return <tt>reverse_iterator</tt>s. Of the
other methods, the other constructors, <tt>base()</tt>, <tt>operator+</tt>, <tt>operator-</tt>,
<tt>operator[]</tt>, and the non-member operators can probably also be
<tt>constexpr</tt>.
<p/>
<tt>operator*</tt> cannot be constexpr because it involves an assignment to a
member variable. Discussion starting with c++std-lib-33282 indicated
that it would be useful to make reverse_iterator a literal type
despite this restriction on its use at compile time.
