<p>
The library provides several traits mechanisms intended a
customization points for users. Typically, they are
declared in headers that are growing quite large. This is
not a problem for standard library vendors, who can
manage their internal file structure to avoid large
dependencies, but can be a problem for end users who
have no option but to include these large headers.

There was no enthusiasm for touching <tt>char_traits</tt> or <tt>regex_traits</tt>.
Consensus to move <tt>iterator_traits</tt>, <tt>allocator_traits</tt>
and <tt>pointer_traits</tt> to their own respective headers once wording supplied.

After some discussion, consensus is that moving these features into separate
headers does not buy much in practice, as the larger headers will inevitably
be included anyway.  Resolve as NAD.

Resolution proposed in ballot comment

<p>
Move the following traits classes into their own
headers, and require the existing header to
<tt>#include</tt> the traits header to support backwards
compatibility:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
iterator_traits (plus the iterator tag-types)
allocator_traits
pointer_traits
char_traits
regex_traits
</pre></blockquote>
</discussion>

<resolution>
This suggest is not a defect, as the likely benefit is small, if any,
compared to the cost of not just implementating the feature, but also
explaining/teaching it.
</resolution>
