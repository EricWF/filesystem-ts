<discussion>
The library provides several traits mechanisms intended a
customization points for users. Typically, they are
declared in headers that are growing quite large. This is
not a problem for standard library vendors, who can
manage their internal file structure to avoid large
dependencies, but can be a problem for end users who
have no option but to include these large headers.
</discussion>

<resolution>
Move the following traits classes into their own
headers, and require the existing header to
#include the traits header to support backwards
compatibility:<BR/>
iterator_traits (plus the iterator tag-types)<BR/>
allocator_traits<BR/>
pointer_traits<BR/>
char_traits<BR/>
regex_traits
</resolution>

</issue>
