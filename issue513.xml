<p>
Paragraph 3 begins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The size of the state is r.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, this is not quite consistent with the remainder of the paragraph
which specifies a total  of nr+1 items in the textual representation of
the state.  We recommend the sentence be corrected to match:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The size of the state is nr+1.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
To give meaning to the coefficient n, it may be also desirable to move
n's definition from later in the paragraph.  Either of the following
seem reasonable formulations:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
With n=..., the size of the state is nr+1.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
The size of the state is nr+1, where n=... .
</p></blockquote>

<note>
Jens:  I plead for "NAD" on the grounds that "size of state" is only
used as an argument for big-O complexity notation, thus
constant factors and additions don't count.

<note>
Berlin: N1932 adopts the proposed NAD.
