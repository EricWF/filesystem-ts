<title>Way objects hold allocators unclear</title>

<discussion>
<p>I couldn't find a statement in the standard saying whether the allocator object held by
a container is held as a copy of the constructor argument or whether a pointer of
reference is maintained internal. There is an according statement for compare objects and
how they are maintained by the associative containers, but I couldn't find anything
regarding allocators. </p>

<p>Did I overlook it? Is it an open issue or known defect? Or is it deliberately left
unspecified? </p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect. The LWG believes that the Standard is already
clear.&nbsp; See <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>, paragraph 8.</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
