<discussion>
<p>The sprintf format string , "%.01f" (that's the digit one), in the
description of the do_put() member functions of the money_put facet in
22.2.6.2.2, p1 is incorrect. First, the f format specifier is wrong
for values of type long double, and second, the precision of 01
doesn't seem to make sense. What was most likely intended was
"%.0Lf"., that is a precision of zero followed by the L length
modifier.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change the format string to "%.0Lf".</p>
</resolution>

<rationale><p>Fixes an obvious typo</p></rationale>
