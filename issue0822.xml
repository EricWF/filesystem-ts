I just noticed that the following program is legal in C++03, but
is forbidden in the current draft:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Toto
{
public:
    Toto() {}
    explicit Toto( Toto const&amp; ) {}
} ;

int
main()
{
    std::vector&lt; Toto &gt; v( 10 ) ;
    return 0 ;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Is this change intentional?  (And if so, what is the
justification?  I wouldn't call such code good, but I don't see
any reason to break it unless we get something else in return.)

The subgroup that looked at this felt this was a good change, but it may
already be handled by incoming concepts (we're not sure).

<blockquote>
<p>
Alisdair: Proposed resolution kinda funky as these tables no longer
exist. Move from direct init to copy init. Clarify with Doug, recommends
NAD.
</p>
<p>
Walter: Suggest NAD via introduction of concepts.
</p>
<p>
Recommend close as NAD.

This issue was re-reviewed in relation to [another issue, number to follow],
and the verdict was reversed.  Explicit copy and move constructors are rare
beasts, and the ripple effect of this fix was far more difficult to contain
than simply saying such types do not satisfy the <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>
and <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In <sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> change Table 33: <tt>MoveConstructible</tt> requirements [moveconstructible]:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>expression</th><th>post-condition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>T t<ins>(rv)</ins><del> = rv</del></tt></td><td><tt>t</tt> is equivalent to the value of <tt>rv</tt> before the construction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" align="center">...</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
In <sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> change Table 34: <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> requirements [copyconstructible]:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>expression</th><th>post-condition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>T t<ins>(u)</ins><del> = u</del></tt></td><td>the value of <tt>u</tt> is unchanged and is equivalent to <tt>t</tt></td>
</tr>
