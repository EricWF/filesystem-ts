<discussion>
<p>Even if to and from are different paths, they may be equivalent.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Specify what happens if (options & copy_options::overwrite_existing) but from and to
resolve to the same file.</p>

  <p/>
  <i>[Beman Dawes: 9 Feb 2014: Need advice on this issue:]</i>

  <p/>What do existing implentations do?

  <p/>Possible resolutions:
  <ol>
    <li>Treat it as an error.</li>
    <li>Once equivalence is determined, take no further action and return true? false?</li>
    <li>Don't bother to detect a file overwriting itself. This will likely result in an error, anyhow.</li>
  </ol>
</resolution>

</issue>
