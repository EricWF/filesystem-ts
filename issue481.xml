<title>unique's effects on the range [result, last)</title>

<p>
The standard says that unique(first, last) "eliminates all but the
first element from every consecutive group of equal elements" in
[first, last) and returns "the end of the resulting range".  So a
postcondition is that [first, result) is the same as the old [first,
last) except that duplicates have been eliminated.
</p>

<p>What postconditions are there on the range [result, last)?  One
  might argue that the standard says nothing about those values, so
  they can be anything.  One might also argue that the standard
  doesn't permit those values to be changed, so they must not be.
  Should the standard say something explicit one way or the other?</p>

<rationale>
<p>We don't want to make many guarantees about what's in [result,
end). Maybe we aren't being quite explicit enough about not being
explicit, but it's hard to think that's a major problem.</p>
