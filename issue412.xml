<title>Typo in 27.4.4.3</title>

<discussion>
<p>
The Effects clause in <sref ref="[iostate.flags]"/> paragraph 5 says that the
function only throws if the respective bits are already set prior to
the function call. That's obviously not the intent. The typo ought to
be corrected and the text reworded as: "If (<i>state</i> &amp;
exceptions()) == 0, returns. ..."
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
In <sref ref="[iostate.flags]"/> paragraph 5, replace "If (rdstate() &amp;
exceptions()) == 0" with "If ((state | (rdbuf() ? goodbit : badbit))
&amp; exceptions()) == 0".
</p>

<note>Kona: the original proposed resolution wasn't quite right.  We
  really do mean rdstate(); the ambiguity is that the wording in the
  standard doesn't make it clear whether we mean rdstate() before
  setting the new state, or rdsate() after setting it.  We intend the
  latter, of course. Post-Kona: Martin provided wording.</note>

</resolution>
