<p><b>Addresses GB-56</b></p>
<p>
The &lt;utility&gt; header provides support for several
important C++ idioms with move, forward and swap.
Likewise, declval will be frequently used like a type trait.
In order to complete cycles introduced by std::pair, the
&lt;tuple&gt; header should also be made available. This is a
similarly primitive set of functionality, with no dependency
of a hosted environment, but does go beyond the minimal
set of functionality otherwise suggested by the
freestanding libraries.
Alternatively, split the move/forward/swap/declval
functions out of &lt;utility&gt; and into a new primitive header,
requiring only that of freestanding implementation.

<p>
Add &lt;utility&gt; and &lt;tuple&gt; to table 15, headers
required for a free-standing implementation.
