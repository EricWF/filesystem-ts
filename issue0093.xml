<discussion>
<p>You can easily create subsets, but you can't easily combine them
with other subsets.  Unfortunately, you almost always needs an
explicit type conversion to valarray. This is because the standard
does not specify that valarray subsets provide the same operations as
valarrays. </p>

<p>For example, to multiply two subsets and assign the result to a third subset, you can't
write the following:</p>

<pre>va[slice(0,4,3)] = va[slice(1,4,3)] * va[slice(2,4,3)];</pre>

<p>Instead, you have to code as follows:</p>

<pre>va[slice(0,4,3)] = static_cast&lt;valarray&lt;double&gt; &gt;(va[slice(1,4,3)]) * 
                   static_cast&lt;valarray&lt;double&gt; &gt;(va[slice(2,4,3)]);</pre>

<p>This is tedious and error-prone. Even worse, it costs performance because each cast
creates a temporary objects, which could be avoided without the cast. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Extend all valarray subset types so that they offer all valarray operations.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>This is not a defect in the Standard; it is a request for an extension.</p>
</rationale>
