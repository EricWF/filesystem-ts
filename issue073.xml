<title><tt>is_open</tt> should be const</title>

<discussion>
<p>Classes <tt>basic_ifstream</tt>, <tt>basic_ofstream</tt>, and
<tt>basic_fstream</tt> all have a member function <tt>is_open</tt>. It
should be a <tt>const</tt> member function, since it does nothing but
call one of <tt>basic_filebuf</tt>'s const member functions. </p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect. This is a deliberate feature; const streams would be
meaningless.</p>
