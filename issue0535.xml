<title>std::string::swap specification poorly worded</title>

std::string::swap currently says for effects and postcondition:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Swaps the contents of the two strings.
</p>

<p>
<i>Postcondition:</i> <tt>*this</tt> contains the characters that were in <tt><i>s</i></tt>,
<tt><i>s</i></tt> contains the characters that were in <tt>*this</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Specifying both Effects and Postcondition seems redundant, and the postcondition
needs to be made stronger. Users would be unhappy if the characters were not in
the same order after the swap.
