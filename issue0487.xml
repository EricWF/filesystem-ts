The standard's version of allocator::construct(pointer,
const_reference) severely limits what you can construct using this
function.  Say you can construct a socket from a file descriptor. Now,
using this syntax, I first have to manually construct a socket from
the fd, and then pass the constructed socket to the construct()
function so it will just to an uninitialized copy of the socket I
manually constructed. Now it may not always be possible to copy
construct a socket eh! So, I feel that the changes should go in the
allocator::construct(), making it:
</p>
<pre>
    template&lt;typename T>
    struct allocator{
      template&lt;typename T1>
      void construct(pointer T1 const&amp; rt1);
    };
</pre>

<p>
Now, the ctor of the class T which matches the one that takes a T1 can
be called! Doesn't that sound great?

<p>NAD. STL uses copying all the time, and making it possible for
  allocators to construct noncopyable objects is useless in the
  absence of corresponding container changes. We might consider this
  as part of a larger redesign of STL.</p>
