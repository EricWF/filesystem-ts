<title>tuple query APIs do not support references</title>

<p>
The <tt>tuple</tt> query APIs <tt>tuple_size</tt> and
<tt>tuple_element</tt> do not support references-to-tuples.  This can be
annoying when a template deduced a parameter type to be a reference,
which must be explicitly stripped with <tt>remove_reference</tt> before calling
these APIs.
</p>
<p>
I am not proposing a resolution at this point, as there is a
combinatorial explosion with lvalue/rvalue references and
cv-qualification (see previous issue) that suggests some higher
refactoring is in order.  This might be something to kick back over to
Core/Evolution.
</p>
<p>
Note that we have the same problem in numeric_limits.
