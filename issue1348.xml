<p>
There are a number of unspecified types used throughout
the library, such as the container iterators. Many of these
unspecified types have restrictions or expectations on
their behaviour in terms of exceptions. Are they permitted
or required to use exception specifications, more
specifically the new <tt>noexcept</tt> specification? For example,
if <tt>vector&lt;T>::iterator</tt> is implemented as a native pointer,
all its operations will have an (effective) <tt>noexcept</tt>
specification. If the implementation uses a class type to
implement this iterator, is it permitted or required to
support that same guarantee?
</p>

<p>
Clearly state the requirements for exception
specifications on all unspecified library types. For
example, all container iterator operations should
be conditionally <tt>noexcept</tt>, with the condition
matching the same operation applied to the
allocator's <tt>pointer_type</tt>, a certain subset of which
are already required not to throw.
