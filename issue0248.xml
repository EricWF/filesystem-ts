<title>time_get fails to set eofbit</title>

<discussion>
<p>There is no requirement that any of time_get member functions set
ios::eofbit when they reach the end iterator while parsing their input.
Since members of both the num_get and money_get facets are required to
do so (22.2.2.1.2, and 22.2.6.1.2, respectively), time_get members
should follow the same requirement for consistency.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add paragraph 2 to section 22.2.5.1 with the following text:</p>

<blockquote><p>
If the end iterator is reached during parsing by any of the get()
member functions, the member sets ios_base::eofbit in err.
</p></blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>Two alternative resolutions were proposed.  The LWG chose this one
because it was more consistent with the way eof is described for other
input facets.</p>
</rationale>
