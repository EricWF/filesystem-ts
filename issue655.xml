<title>Signature of generate_canonical not useful</title>

<p>
In <sref ref="[rand.synopsis]"/> we have the declaration
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class RealType, class UniformRandomNumberGenerator,
  size_t bits&gt;
result_type generate_canonical(UniformRandomNumberGenerator&amp; g);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Besides the "result_type" issue (already recognized by Bo Persson
at Sun, 11 Feb 2007 05:26:47 GMT in this group) it's clear, that
the template parameter order is not reasonably choosen: Obviously
one always needs to specify all three parameters, although usually
only two are required, namely the result type RealType and the
wanted bits, because UniformRandomNumberGenerator can usually
be deduced.
