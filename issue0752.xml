<title>Allocator complexity requirement</title>

<p>
Did LWG recently discuss <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>-2, which states that "All the operations
on the allocators are expected to be amortized constant time."?
</p>
<p>
As I think I pointed out earlier, this is currently fiction for
<tt>allocate()</tt> if it has to obtain memory from the OS, and it's unclear to
me how to interpret this for <tt>construct()</tt> and <tt>destroy()</tt> if they deal with
large objects.  Would it be controversial to officially let these take
time linear in the size of the object, as they already do in real life?
</p>
<p>
<tt>Allocate()</tt> more blatantly takes time proportional to the size of the
object if you mix in GC.  But it's not really a new problem, and I think
we'd be confusing things by leaving the bogus requirements there.  The
current requirement on <tt>allocate()</tt> is generally not important anyway,
since it takes O(size) to construct objects in the resulting space.
There are real performance issues here, but they're all concerned with
the constants, not the asymptotic complexity.

<resolution>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>/2:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-2- Table 39 describes the requirements on types manipulated through
allocators. <del>All the operations on the allocators are expected to be
amortized constant time.</del> Table 40 describes the
requirements on allocator types.
</p>
</blockquote>
