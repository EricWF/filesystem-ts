<title>Typo in <tt>scan_is()</tt> semantics</title>
<section><sref ref="[locale.ctype.virtuals]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>The semantics of <tt>scan_is()</tt> (paragraphs 4 and 6) is not exactly described
because there is no function <tt>is()</tt> which only takes a character as
argument. Also, in the effects clause (paragraph 3), the semantic is also kept
vague.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[locale.ctype.virtuals]"/> paragraphs 4 and 6, change the returns
clause from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;... such that <tt>is(*p)</tt>
would...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:&nbsp; &quot;... such that <tt>is(m, *p)</tt>
 would....&quot;</p>
</resolution>
