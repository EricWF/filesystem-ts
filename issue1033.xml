<p>
While looking at <tt>thread::join()</tt> I think I spotted a couple of
possible defects in the specifications. I could not find a previous
issue or NB comment about that, but I might have missed it.
</p>

<p>
The postconditions clause for <tt>thread::join()</tt> is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Postconditions:</i> If <tt>join()</tt> throws an exception, the value
returned by <tt>get_id()</tt> is unchanged. Otherwise, <tt>get_id() == id()</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>
and the throws clause is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Throws:</i> <tt>std::system_error</tt> when the postconditions cannot be achieved.
</blockquote>

<p>
Now... how could the postconditions <em>not</em> be achieved?
It's just a matter of resetting the value of <tt>get_id()</tt> or leave it
unchanged! I bet we can always do that. Moreover, it's a chicken-and-egg
problem: in order to decide whether to throw or not I depend on the
postconditions, but the postconditions are different in the two cases.
</p>

<p>
I believe the throws clause should be:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>Throws:</i> <tt>std::system_error</tt> when the effects or postconditions
cannot be achieved.
</blockquote>

<p>
as it is in <tt>detach()</tt>, or, even better, as the postcondition is
trivially satisfiable and to remove the circular dependency:
</p>


<blockquote>
<i>Throws:</i> <tt>std::system_error</tt> if the effects cannot be achieved.
</blockquote>

<p>
Problem is that... ehm... <tt>join()</tt> has no "Effects" clause. Is that intentional?

Pete believes there may be some more general language (in frontmatter)
that can address this and related issues such as <iref ref="962"/>.

Move to Open.

Edit <sref ref="[thread.thread.member]"/> as indicated:

void join();

<p>

6 <i>Synchronization:</i> The completion of the thread represented by
<tt>*this</tt> happens before (<sref ref="[intro.multithread]"/>)
<tt>join()</tt> returns. [<i>Note:</i> Operations on <tt>*this</tt> are not
synchronized. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
