<p><b>Addresses UK 165</b></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>Constraints on
        bitmask and enumeration types were supposed to be tightened
        up as part of the motivation for the <tt>constexpr</tt> feature -
        see paper
        <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2235.pdf">N2235</a>
        for details</p>
<p><b>Suggestion</b></p>
        <p>Adopt wording in line with the motivation
        described in
        <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2235.pdf">N2235</a></p>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<rationale>
<p>
UK NB did not sufficiently describe how to resolve their comment, and
therefore we cannot make a change for the FCD. If a resolution were
provided in the future, we would be happy to apply it.
