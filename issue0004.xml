<p>The concept of a parent directory for dot or dotdot exists, but the definition doesn't apply.</p>

<p>Suggested action:</p>

<p>Remove the paragraph. This concept does not apply to dot and dot-dot. Add a definition for dot and dot-dot.</p>

<note>2014-02-07, Beman Dawes comments</note>
<p>Suggest it is editorial and should be passed to the project editor.</p>

  <note>
    2014-02-11 Issaquah: Beman to provide wording for review next meeting. Also see related issue 5.
