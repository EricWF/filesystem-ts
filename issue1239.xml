<p>
Table 43 defines a number of traits that yield true for arrays of class
types with the trait's property, but not arrays of other types with that
property.  For example, <tt>has_trivial_default_constructor</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>T</tt> is a trivial type (3.9) or a class type with a trivial default
constructor (12.1) or an array of such a class type.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
An array of a trivial type is a trivial type.
</p>
<p>
Mark as Tentatively NAD Editorial. The wording is OK as is,
since an array of a trivial type is a trivial type, but the wording as
proposed might be clearer.

The wording is OK as is, since an array of a trivial type is a trivial type.
Project editor may wish to accept the suggested wording as editorial.

<resolution>
<p>
Change all the traits in question following this pattern:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<tt>T</tt> is a trivial type (3.9) or a class type with a trivial default
 constructor (12.1)<ins>,</ins> or an array of such a <del>class</del> type.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
i.e., add a comma and delete a "class."
</p>
