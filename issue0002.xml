<title>[PDTS] Tighten specification when there is no reasonable behavior</title>

<discussion>
<p>It is unfortunate that error reporting for inability to provide reasonable behaviour is
completely implementation-defined. This hurts portability in the sense that programmers have no
idea how errors will be reported and cannot anticipate anything.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change “If an implementation cannot provide any reasonable behavior, the implementation
shall report an error in an implementation-defined manner.” to “If an implementation cannot
provide any reasonable behavior, the code using the facilities for which reasonable behaviour
cannot be provided shall be ill-formed.” and strike the note.</p>
</resolution>
