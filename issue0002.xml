<title>Auto_ptr conversions effects incorrect</title>
<section><sref ref="[auto.ptr.conv]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Paragraph 1 in &quot;Effects&quot;, says &quot;Calls
p-&gt;release()&quot; where it clearly must be &quot;Calls
p.release()&quot;. (As it is, it seems to require using
auto_ptr&lt;&gt;::operator-&gt; to refer to X::release, assuming that
exists.)</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[meta.unary.prop]"/> paragraph 1 Effects from 
&quot;Calls p-&gt;release()&quot; to &quot;Calls p.release()&quot;.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect: the proposed change is already found in the standard.
[Originally classified as a defect, later reclassified.]</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
