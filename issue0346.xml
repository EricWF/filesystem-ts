<title>Some iterator member functions should be const</title>
<section><sref ref="[iterator.concepts]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>Iterator member functions and operators that do not change the state
of the iterator should be defined as const member functions or as
functions that take iterators either by const reference or by
value. The standard does not explicitly state which functions should
be const.  Since this a fairly common mistake, the following changes
are suggested to make this explicit.</p>

<p>The tables almost indicate constness properly through naming: r
for non-const and a,b for const iterators. The following changes
make this more explicit and also fix a couple problems.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In <sref ref="[iterator.concepts]"/> Change the first section of p9 from
"In the following sections, a and b denote values of X..." to
"In the following sections, a and b denote values of type const X...".</p>

<p>In Table 73, change</p>
<pre>
    a-&gt;m   U&amp;         ...
</pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre>
    a-&gt;m   const U&amp;   ...
    r-&gt;m   U&amp;         ...
</pre>

<p>In Table 73 expression column, change</p>

<pre>
    *a = t
</pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre>
    *r = t
</pre>

<note>Redmond: The container requirements should be reviewed to see if
the same problem appears there.</note>
