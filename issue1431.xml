<p><b>Addresses US-120</b></p>

is_permutation is underspecified for anything but the
simple case where both ranges have the same value type
and the comparison function is an equivalence relation.

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

<resolution>
Restrict is_permutation to the case where it is well
specified. See Appendix 1 - Additional Details
