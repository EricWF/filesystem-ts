<p>
There is no compelling reason to assume a
heterogeneous tuple of two elements holds a pair of
iterators forming a valid range. Unlike <tt>std::pair</tt>, there are
no functions in the standard library using this as a return
type with a valid range, so there is even less reason to try
to adapt this type for the new for-loop syntax.

Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.
