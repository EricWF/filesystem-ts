<title>Basic_ios destructor unspecified</title>
<section><sref ref="[basic.ios.cons]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>There's nothing in 27.4.4 saying what basic_ios's destructor does.
The important question is whether basic_ios::~basic_ios() destroys
rdbuf().</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add after <sref ref="[basic.ios.cons]"/> paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>virtual ~basic_ios();</tt></p>
  <p><b>Notes</b>: The destructor does not destroy <tt>rdbuf()</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale> 
<p>The LWG reviewed the additional question of whether or not
<tt>rdbuf(0)</tt> may set <tt>badbit</tt>.  The answer is
clearly yes; it may be set via <tt>clear()</tt>.  See <sref ref="[basic.ios.members]"/>, paragraph 6.  This issue was reviewed at length
by the LWG, which removed from the original proposed resolution a
footnote which incorrectly said &quot;<tt>rdbuf(0)</tt> does not set
<tt>badbit</tt>&quot;.</p>
</rationale>

</issue>
