<p>
It could be I did not understand the design rationale, but I thought
copy_exception would produce an exception_ptr to the most-derived (dynamic)
type of the passed exception.  Instead it slices, which appears to be less
useful, and a likely source of FAQ questions in the future.

<p>
How could this be implemented in a way that the dynamic type is cloned?
</p>
<p>
The feature is designed to create an exception_ptr from an object whose
static type is identical to the dynamic type and thus there is no
slicing involved.
