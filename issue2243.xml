<p>
In <sref ref="[istream.unformatted]"/> / 34, when describing <tt>putback</tt>, it says that "<tt>rdbuf-&gt;sputbackc()</tt>" 
is called. The problem are not the obvious typos in the expression, but the fact that it may lead to different 
interpretations, since nowhere is specified what the required argument to <tt>sputbackc</tt> is.
<p/>
It can be guessed to be "<tt>rdbuf()-&gt;sputbackc(c)</tt>", but "<tt>rdbuf()-&gt;sputbackc(char_type())</tt>" or 
just anything would be as conforming (or non-confoming) as the first guess.
