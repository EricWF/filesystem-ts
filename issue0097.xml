<discussion>
<p><tt>insert(iterator, const value_type&amp;)</tt> is defined both on
sequences and on set, with unrelated semantics: insert here (in
sequences), and insert with hint (in associative containers). They
should have different names (B.S. says: do not abuse overloading).</p>

<rationale>
<p>This is not a defect in the Standard. It is a genetic misfortune of
the design, for better or for worse.</p>
