<p>
After the additions by <iref ref="2033"/>, it appears clear that the intended effect includes a reallocation and 
thus the potential effect on iterators should be explicitly added to the text in order to not contradict 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/11, or at the very least, explicitly state that a reallocation may 
happen.
<p/>
Taking consistency with "reserve" into consideration, I propose:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
that the current "Remarks" are made its "Effect" instead, inserting "Reallocation happens at this point if and only 
if the function effectively reduces the capacity." after the note on non-bindingness.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
adding a "Remarks" paragraph, similar to that of reserve: "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, 
and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence."
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
BTW, while we are at it, I believe the effect on iterators should also be explicitly stated in the other instance 
a reallocation may happen: <sref ref="[vector.modifiers]"/>/1 &mdash; even if obvious, it only contradicts 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/11 implicitly. 
<p/>
I propose to also insert "Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the 
elements in the sequence." at the appropriate location in its "Remarks".

The described problem also affects <tt>std::basic_string</tt> and <tt>std::deque</tt>.

<li><p>Edit <sref ref="[vector.modifiers]"/> p1 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
iterator insert(const_iterator position, const T&amp; x);
iterator insert(const_iterator position, T&amp;&amp; x);

<p>
-1- <i>Remarks</i>: Causes reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity. <ins>Reallocation 
invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence.</ins> If 
no reallocation happens, all the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid. If an 
exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move 
assignment operator of <tt>T</tt> or by any <tt>InputIterator</tt> operation there are no effects. If an 
exception is thrown by the move constructor of a non-<tt>CopyInsertable</tt> <tt>T</tt>, the effects are unspecified.
