<title>Facet definition incomplete</title>

<discussion>
<p>It has been noticed by Esa Pulkkinen that the definition of
&quot;facet&quot; is incomplete. In particular, a class derived from
another facet, but which does not define a member <i>id</i>, cannot
safely serve as the argument <i>F</i> to use_facet&lt;F&gt;(loc),
because there is no guarantee that a reference to the facet instance
stored in <i>loc</i> is safely convertible to <i>F</i>. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>In the definition of std::use_facet&lt;&gt;(), replace the text in paragraph 1 which
reads: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get a reference to a facet of a locale. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>with: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requires: <tt>Facet</tt> is a facet class whose definition
  contains the public static member <tt>id</tt> as defined in <sref ref="[locale.facet]"/>. </p>
</blockquote>

<note>
Kona: strike as overspecification the text &quot;(not inherits)&quot;
from the original resolution, which read &quot;... whose definition
contains (not inherits) the public static member
<tt>id</tt>...&quot;
</note>

</resolution>
