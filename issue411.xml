<title>Wrong names of set member functions</title>
<section><sref ref="[alg.set.operations]"/></section>

<p>
<sref ref="[alg.set.operations]"/> paragraph 1 reads:
"The semantics of the set operations are generalized to multisets in a 
standard way by defining union() to contain the maximum number of 
occurrences of every element, intersection() to contain the minimum, and 
so on."
</p>

<p>
This is wrong.  The name of the functions are set_union() and
set_intersection(), not union() and intersection().
</p>

<resolution>
<p>Change that sentence to use the correct names.</p>
</resolution>
