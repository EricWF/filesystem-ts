</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[using.linkage]"/> paragraph 2
from:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is unspecified whether a name from the Standard C library
  declared with external linkage has either extern &quot;C&quot; or
  extern &quot;C++&quot; linkage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether a name from the Standard C library declared with external
  linkage has extern &quot;C&quot; or extern &quot;C++&quot; linkage
  is implementation defined. It is recommended that an implementation
  use extern &quot;C++&quot; linkage for this purpose.</p>
