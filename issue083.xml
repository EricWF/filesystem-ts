<title>String::npos vs. string::max_size()</title>

<discussion>
<p>Many string member functions throw if size is getting or exceeding
npos. However, I wonder why they don't throw if size is getting or
exceeding max_size() instead of npos.  May be npos is known at compile
time, while max_size() is known at runtime. However, what happens if
size exceeds max_size() but not npos, then? It seems the standard
lacks some clarifications here.</p>

<resolution>
<p>After <sref ref="[basic.string]"/> paragraph 4 (&quot;The functions
described in this clause...&quot;) add a new paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any string operation, if as a result of the operation, <tt> size()</tt> would exceed
  <tt> max_size()</tt> then
  the operation throws <tt>length_error</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>The LWG believes length_error is the correct exception to throw.</p>
