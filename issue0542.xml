The intent is for both use_count() and unique() to work in a threaded environment.
They are intrinsically prone to race conditions, but they never return garbage.

This is a crucial piece of information that I really wish were
captured in the text. Having this in a non-normative note would
have made everything crystal clear to me and probably stopped
me from ever starting this discussion :) Instead, the sentence
in p12 "use only for debugging and testing purposes, not for
production code" very strongly suggests that implementations
can and even are encouraged to return garbage (when threads
are involved) for performance reasons.

<p>
How about adding an informative note along these lines:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Note: Implementations are encouraged to provide well-defined
  behavior for use_count() and unique() even in the presence of
  multiple threads.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I don't necessarily insist on the exact wording, just that we
capture the intent.

Change <sref ref="[util.smartptr.shared.obs]"/> p12:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note:</i> <tt>use_count()</tt> is not necessarily efficient. <del>Use only for
debugging and testing purposes, not for production code.</del> --<i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Change <sref ref="[util.smartptr.weak.obs]"/> p3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Note:</i> <tt>use_count()</tt> is not necessarily efficient. <del>Use only for
debugging and testing purposes, not for production code.</del> --<i>end note</i>]
