<title>Underspecified semantics for <tt>setbuf()</tt></title>

<discussion>
<p>The default behavior of <tt>setbuf()</tt> is described only for the
situation that <tt>gptr() != 0 &amp;&amp; gptr() != egptr()</tt>:
namely to do nothing.  What has to be done in other situations&nbsp;
is not described although there is actually only one reasonable
approach, namely to do nothing, too.</p> 

<p>Since changing the buffer would almost certainly mess up most
buffer management of derived classes unless these classes do it
themselves, the default behavior of <tt>setbuf()</tt> should always be
to do nothing.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[streambuf.virt.buffer]"/>, paragraph 3, Default behavior,
to: &quot;Default behavior: Does nothing. Returns this.&quot;</p>
</resolution>
