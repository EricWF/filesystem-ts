<p><b>Addresses US-100</b></p>
<p>
LWG 1281 was discussed in Pittsburgh, and the decision
there was to accept the typedef as proposed and move to
Review. Unfortunately the issue was accidentally applied
to the FCD, and incorrectly. The FCD version of the
typedef refers to <tt>ratio&lt;N, D&gt;</tt>, but the typedef is intended
to refer to <tt>ratio&lt;num, den&gt;</tt> which in general is not the
same type.
</p>

<note>
Resolved in Rapperswil by a motion to directly apply the words from the ballot comment in N3102.

<resolution><p>

<tt>typedef ratio&lt;num, den&gt; type;</tt>
</p></resolution>
