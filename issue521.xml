2.1.2/3, second bullet item currently says that reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt; is
derived from unary_function&lt;T, R&gt; if T is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
a pointer to member function type with cv-qualifier cv and no arguments;
the type T1 is cv T* and R is the return type of the pointer to member function;
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The type of T1 can't be cv T*, 'cause that's a pointer to a pointer to member
function. It should be a pointer to the class that T is a pointer to member of.
Like this:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
a pointer to a member function R T0::f() cv (where cv represents the member
function's cv-qualifiers); the type T1 is cv T0*
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, bullet item 2 in 2.1.2/4 should be:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
a pointer to a member function R T0::f(T2) cv (where cv represents the member
function's cv-qualifiers); the type T1 is cv T0*
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Change bullet item 2 in 2.1.2/3:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
a pointer to member function <del>type with cv-qualifier <tt><i>cv</i></tt> and no arguments;
the type <tt>T1</tt> is <tt><i>cv</i> T*</tt> and <tt>R</tt> is the return 
type of the pointer to member function</del> <ins><tt>R T0::f() <i>cv</i></tt>
(where <tt><i>cv</i></tt> represents the member function's cv-qualifiers);
the type <tt>T1</tt> is <tt><i>cv</i> T0*</tt></ins>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Change bullet item 2 in 2.1.2/4:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
a pointer to member function <del>with cv-qualifier <tt><i>cv</i></tt> and taking one argument
of type <tt>T2</tt>; the type <tt>T1</tt> is <tt><i>cv</i> T*</tt> and 
<tt>R</tt> is the return type of the pointer to member function</del>
<ins><tt>R T0::f(T2) <i>cv</i></tt> (where <tt><i>cv</i></tt> represents the member
function's cv-qualifiers); the type <tt>T1</tt> is <tt><i>cv</i> T0*</tt></ins>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
