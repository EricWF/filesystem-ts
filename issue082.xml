<p>Paragraph 5 specifies:</p>

<blockquote><p>
For set and multiset the value type is the same as the key type. For
map and multimap it is equal to pair&lt;const Key, T&gt;.  
</p></blockquote>

<p>Strictly speaking, this is not correct because for set and multiset
the value type is the same as the <b>constant</b> key type.</p>
</discussion>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect. The Standard is correct as written; it uses a
different mechanism (const &amp;) for <tt>set</tt> and
<tt>multiset</tt>. See issue <iref ref="103"/> for a related
issue.</p>
