<title>[PDTS] Request for <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> and/or <tt>touch()</tt></title>

<discussion>
<p>Since create_symlink(), create_hardlink(), and create_directory() exist, thereâ€™s
no reason not to have a create_regular_file() function.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Consider adding a function create_regular_file() with the behaviour of the POSIX touch
command.</p>

<p>[Beman comments] <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> and <tt>touch()</tt> should be different functions since
their behavior would differ if the file already exists; touch() updates the last write
date.</p>

<p>I have often wanted <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> but never got around to adding it.</p>

<p>While touch is quite useful from the command line, I'm less sure of its usefulness as
a library function. It is trivial for a user to implement.</p>

<p>Whether or not it is appropriate to add operational functions this late in the PDTS
process is questionable.</p>
