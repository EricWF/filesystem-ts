<p>
Since <tt>create_symlink()</tt>, <tt>create_hardlink()</tt>, and <tt>create_directory()</tt> exist, there's
no reason not to have a <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> function.
</p>
<p>
Consider adding a function <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> with the behaviour of the POSIX <tt>touch</tt>
command.
</p>

<note>Beman comments</note>
<p> 
<tt>create_regular_file()</tt> and <tt>touch()</tt> should be different functions since
their behavior would differ if the file already exists; touch() updates the last write
date.
</p>

<p>I have often wanted <tt>create_regular_file()</tt> but never got around to adding it.</p>

<p>While <tt>touch</tt> is quite useful from the command line, I'm less sure of its usefulness as
a library function. It is trivial for a user to implement.</p>

<p>Whether or not it is appropriate to add operational functions this late in the PDTS
process is questionable.</p>
