<title>Typo in naming the class defining the class <tt>Init</tt></title>
<section><sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>There are conflicting statements about where the class
<tt>Init</tt> is defined. According to <sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/> paragraph 2
it is defined as <tt>basic_ios::Init</tt>, according to <sref ref="[ios.base]"/> it is defined as <tt>ios_base::Init</tt>.</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Change <sref ref="[iostream.objects]"/> paragraph 2 from
&quot;<tt>basic_ios::Init&quot;</tt> to
&quot;<tt>ios_base::Init&quot;</tt>.</p>
</resolution>

<rationale>
<p>Although not strictly wrong, the standard was misleading enough to warrant
the change.</p>
</rationale>
