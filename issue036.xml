<title>Iword &amp; pword storage lifetime omitted</title>
<section><sref ref="[ios.base.storage]"/></section>

<discussion>
<p>In the definitions for ios_base::iword and pword, the lifetime of the storage is
specified badly, so that an implementation which only keeps the last value stored appears
to conform. In particular, it says: </p>

<p>The reference returned may become invalid after another call to the object's iword
member with a different index ... </p>

<p>This is not idle speculation; at least one implementation was done this way. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>Add in <sref ref="[ios.base.storage]"/>, in both paragraph 2 and also in
paragraph 4, replace the sentence: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reference returned may become invalid after another call to the object's iword
  [pword] member with a different index, after a call to its copyfmt member, or when the
  object is destroyed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>with: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reference returned is invalid after any other operations on the object. However,
  the value of the storage referred to is retained, so that until the next call to copyfmt,
  calling iword [pword] with the same index yields another reference to the same value. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>substituting &quot;iword&quot; or &quot;pword&quot; as appropriate. </p>
</resolution>
