<p><b>Addresses US 91</b></p>

<p>
It is unclear whether or not a failed <tt>compare_exchange</tt> is a RMW operation
(as used in <sref ref="[intro.multithread]"/>).
</p>

<p>
Suggested solution:
</p>

<p>
Make failing <tt>compare_exchange</tt> operations <b>not</b> be RMW.
</p>

Anthony Williams adds:
</note>

<blockquote><p>
In <sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/> p18 it says that "These
operations are atomic read-modify-write operations" (final sentence).
This is overly restrictive on the implementations of
<tt>compare_exchange_weak</tt> and <tt>compare_exchange_strong</tt> on platforms without a
native CAS instruction.

<resolution>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[atomics.types.operations]"/> p18:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
-18- <i>Effects:</i> Atomically, compares the value pointed to by
<tt>object</tt> or by <tt>this</tt> for equality with that in
<tt>expected</tt>, and if true, replaces the value pointed to by
<tt>object</tt> or by <tt>this</tt> with desired, and if false, updates
the value in <tt>expected</tt> with the value pointed to by
<tt>object</tt> or by <tt>this</tt>. Further, if the comparison is true,
memory is affected according to the value of <tt>success</tt>, and if the
comparison is false, memory is affected according to the value of
<tt>failure</tt>. When only one <tt>memory_order</tt> argument is
supplied, the value of <tt>success</tt> is <tt>order</tt>, and the value
of <tt>failure</tt> is <tt>order</tt> except that a value of
<tt>memory_order_acq_rel</tt> shall be replaced by the value
<tt>memory_order_acquire</tt> and a value of
<tt>memory_order_release</tt> shall be replaced by the value
<tt>memory_order_relaxed</tt>. <ins>If the comparison is <tt>true</tt>, </ins>
<del>T</del><ins>t</ins>hese operations are atomic
read-modify-write operations (1.10). 
<ins>If the comparison is <tt>false</tt>, these
operations are atomic load operations.</ins>
