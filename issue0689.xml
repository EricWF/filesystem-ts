<title>reference_wrapper constructor overly constrained</title>

<discussion>
<p>
The constructor of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is currently <tt>explicit</tt>. The primary
motivation behind this is the safety problem with respect to rvalues,
which is addressed by the proposed resolution of the previous issue.
Therefore we should consider relaxing the requirements on the
constructor since requests for the implicit conversion keep resurfacing.
</p>
<p>
Also please see the thread starting at c++std-lib-17398 for some good discussion on this subject.

<resolution>
<p>
Remove the <tt>explicit</tt> from the constructor of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt>. If the
proposed resolution of the previous issue is accepted, remove the
<tt>explicit</tt> from the <tt>T&amp;&amp;</tt> constructor as well to keep them in sync.
</p>
</resolution>
