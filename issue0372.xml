<title>Inconsistent description of stdlib exceptions</title>

<discussion>

<p>Paragraph 3 under clause <sref ref="[res.on.exception.handling]"/>, Restrictions on
Exception Handling, states that "Any other functions defined in the
C++ Standard Library that do not have an exception-specification may
throw implementation-defined exceptions unless otherwise specified."
This statement is followed by a reference to footnote 178 at the
bottom of that page which states, apparently in reference to the C++
Standard Library, that "Library implementations are encouraged (but
not required) to report errors by throwing exceptions from (or derived
from) the standard exceptions."</p>

<p>These statements appear to be in direct contradiction to clause
<sref ref="[type.info]"/>, which states "The class exception defines the
base class for the types of objects thrown as exceptions by the C++
Standard library components ...".</p>

<p>Is this inconsistent?</p>

<rationale>
<p>Clause 17 is setting the overall library requirements, and it's
  clear and consistent.  This sentence from Clause 18 is descriptive,
  not setting a requirement on any other class.
</p>
</rationale>
