<p>Although the Standard has made this mistake almost a dozen times, I recommend not
depicting directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator as deriving from
std::iterator, since that's a binding requirement on implementations.
Instead they should be depicted as having the appropriate typedefs, and leave it up to
implementers to decide how to provide them.  (The difference is observable to users with
is_base_of, not that they should be asking that question.)</p>
