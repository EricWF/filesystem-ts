<discussion>
<p>D.7.1.3, paragraph 19, says that strstreambuf::setbuf
&quot;Performs an operation that is defined separately for each class
derived from strstreambuf&quot;. This is obviously an incorrect
cut-and-paste from basic_streambuf. There are no classes derived from
strstreambuf. </p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p><sref ref="[depr.strstreambuf.virtuals]"/>, paragraph 19, replace the setbuf effects
clause which currently says &quot;Performs an operation that is
defined separately for each class derived from strstreambuf&quot;
with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Effects</b>: implementation defined, except that
  <tt>setbuf(0,0)</tt> has no effect.</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>
