<p><b>Addresses GB-132</b></p>

The atomic_itype types and atomic_address have two
overloads of operator= --- one is volatile qualified, and the
other is not. atomic_bool only has the volatile qualified
version:<BR/>
bool operator=(bool) volatile;<BR/>
On a non-volatile-qualified object this is ambiguous with
the deleted copy-assignment operator<BR/>
atomic_bool&amp; operator=(atomic_bool const&amp;) = delete;<BR/>
due to the need for a single standard conversion in each
case when assigning a bool to an atomic_bool as in:
<PRE>
atomic_bool b;
b=true;
</PRE>
The conversions are atomic_bool&amp; -&gt; atomic_bool
volatile&amp; vs bool -&gt; atomic_bool
</discussion>

<resolution>
Add the "bool operator=(bool);" overload to
atomic_bool in 29.5.1
</resolution>

</issue>
