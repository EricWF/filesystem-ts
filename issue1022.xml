<p>
The pointer-safety API is nothing to do with smart pointers, so does not
belong in <sref ref="[util.smartptr]"/>. In fact it is a set of language
support features are really belongs in clause <sref
ref="[language.support]"/>, with the contents declared in a header that
deals with language-support of memory management.

<blockquote>
Agree in principle, but not with the proposed resolution. We believe it
belongs either a subsection of either <sref ref="[utilities]"/> or <sref
ref="[memory]"/> as part of the general reorganization of <sref
ref="[utilities]"/>. The declaration should stay in
<tt>&lt;memory&gt;</tt>.
