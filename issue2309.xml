As discussed during the Chicago meeting in 
<a href="http://wiki.edg.com/twiki/bin/view/Wg21chicago2013/ThursdayMorningMinutes#LWG_2135_revisited">SG1</a>
the only reasonable reasons for throwing <tt>device_or_resource_busy</tt> seem to be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
The thread currently already holds the mutex, the mutex is not recursive, and the implementation detects this.
In this case <tt>resource_deadlock_would_occur</tt> should be thrown.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Priority reasons. At least <tt>std::mutex</tt> (and possibly all standard mutex types)
should not be setup this way, otherwise we have real problems with <tt>condition_variable::wait()</tt>.
</p></li>
</ul>
