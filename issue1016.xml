<p><b>Addresses JP 33</b></p>

<p>
<tt>LessThanComparable</tt> and <tt>EqualityComparable</tt> don't correspond to NaN. 
</p>

<p><b>Original proposed resolution:</b></p>

<p>
Apply <tt>concept_map</tt> to these concepts at <tt>FloatingPointType</tt>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I don't understand the proposed resolution - there is no such thing as a
'negative' concept_map, and these concepts are auto concepts that match
float/double etc. Also not clear how we are supposed to match values to
concepts.
</p>
<p>
Recommend NAD and treat as a subset of issue <iref ref="902"/>.
