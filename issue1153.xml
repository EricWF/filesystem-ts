<p><b>Addresses DE 2</b></p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>Marking a constructor with <tt>explicit</tt> has semantics
        even for a constructor with zero or several parameters:
        Such a constructor cannot be used with list-initialization
        in a copy-initialization context, see <sref ref="[over.match.list]"/>. The
        standard library apparently has not been reviewed for
        marking non-single-parameter constructors as <tt>explicit</tt>.</p>
<p><b>Suggestion</b></p>
        <p>Consider marking zero-parameter and multi-parameter
        constructors <tt>explicit</tt> in classes that have at least one
        constructor marked <tt>explicit</tt> and that do not have an
        initializer-list constructor.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<rationale>
<p>
We are unaware of any cases where initializer lists cause problem in this
context, but if problems arise in the future the issue can be reopened.
